    <div class="content">

    <p class="MsoNormal">Rudyard Kipling was said to have facetiously suggested that <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> should be put under a glass case as it is too pretty to be part of the real world.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now, about 100 years later, I feel the same about what I&rsquo;ve seen of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan-</st1:place></st1:country-region> it seems too good to be true.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/55-141671240_ebd7a04a10.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Throughout our journey, I&rsquo;ve struggled with the <a href="/dispatch/2006/03/23/authenticity-and-tourism-in-india">authenticity of the tourist experience</a>.<span>&nbsp; </span>In so many places the experience of the tourists seems manufactured with cultural dress, performances and practices being on display with the tourist dollar front-of-mind.<span>&nbsp; </span>As such, I&rsquo;ve become a little cynical about the tourist experience in places like India&rsquo;s Golden Triangle, where it &lsquo;s obvious that the essence of the true culture is sometimes being abstracted and displayed in a way that cheapens and demeans it to a point that it becomes unreal or inauthentic.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">In contrast, the daily experience in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> serves as a full helping of culture that is free from the pretense of purely tourist displays.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example, we are staying in a district of Tokyo called Monzen Nakacho which is far from the tourist trail and offers a true-to-life view of daily life in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan-</st1:place></st1:country-region> a view that, to me, seems authentically real but still unreal in a too-good-to-be-true sort of way.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/52-141361326_d2544b99ff.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Just a block from our hotel is a street that leads to a beautiful Buddhist temple. Along this street are authentic Japanese restaurants and shops filled with Japanese locals, slurping their noodles and drinking their tea just as they do every day.<span>&nbsp; </span>The street itself is stunning in it&rsquo;s cleanliness and style, as if someone set out to create the quintessential Japanese street scene, complete with lanterns, cherry trees, friendly people and noodle shop owners rolling noodles from scratch right there on display.&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/51-141361379_ac35cca621.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p class="MsoNormal">What is most striking to me is that this scene is, without a doubt, the real thing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tourists were not considered when this street became a reality.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is simply a random street in a nice neighborhood of locals that came to being in an authentically Japanese way.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Each evening when we go out, we invariably see women and sometimes men wearing the traditional kimono.<span>&nbsp; </span>Like the shops above, these folks are not thinking of tourists, or making money, or anything but what they feel is the proper attire for their evening out. To the tourists, this is a treat- to see such an authentic and truly beautiful expression of culture in daily life.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/45-141361809_2696416735.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="500" width="375" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">We&rsquo;ve witnessed authentic local culture in many places and I don&rsquo;t mean to sound like authenticity is hard to find.<span>&nbsp; </span>In <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city> though, it seems to take on a new level of uniqueness and in a environment that is perfectly clean and extremely well-cared for- and that is a big difference.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">It&rsquo;s no wonder I have a crush on <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city>.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&quot;m excited to get out of the city and experience more of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>. </p>  <br class="clear" />

  <p class="MsoNormal">The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukiji_fish_market">Tsukiji Seafood Market</a> is <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city> is simply amazing &ndash; and for a number of reasons.<span>&nbsp; </span>Each morning, most of seafood served in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> comes through the wholesale market, where business owners come to buy seafood in bulk and via auction.<span>&nbsp; </span>If it comes from the sea and is served in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, it comes through the Tsukiji Fish Market.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/54-141089055_d8aaf02ddd.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Aside from the sheer volume of the seafood, what was the most impressive was the tourist experience.<span>&nbsp; </span>The overwhelming feeling from the moment you arrive in the market is that you are not supposed to be there.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is a place of very high volumes of business and as a tourist, you are quite simply in the way.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was reminded of this fact by being pushed aside by at least one wholesaler who was clearly tired of dealing with tourists in the market. It was like sailing a catamaran into the shipping lanes of a busy port- you clearly have no business there and you must proceed at your own risk. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;These guys will run you over in a second:</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/53-141088812_d0de4a4160.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">I have feeling that tourist access to the market will be limited in the future as it has for the seafood auction.<span> The market is moving locations soon and my bet is that the tourist experience will change with location.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/52-141089099_2b35a7dd8f.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /> <o:p> <br /></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/49-141089207_3f3cd7c2d4.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="500" width="375" /></p><p class="MsoNormal">Despite being in the way, we proceeded into the bowels of the market and it was an experience I will never forget.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve never seen so many tuna and in such huge sizes.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/45-141089266_786ecc2641.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /> </p><p class="MsoNormal">As our friend Gen described, the fish make an interesting journey to your plate. At the auction, the fish is sold in huge volumes and as the food makes it&#39;s way out of the market and changes hands, it takes on smaller sizes and higher prices.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/51-141089156_221d0ab661.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;For the toursits, the end of chain ends just outside the market where many restaurants serve the freshest and tastiest sushi ever for breakfast.&nbsp; We had the best sushi of our lives for breakfast today including multiple servings of Toro, or fatty tuna which is the filet mingnon of sushi. Simply delictlible.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/46-141089369_9f4e44b800.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;On balance, the seafood market has some sobering elements. The word on the street is that the seas are being over-fished and the sizes of the tuna have been trending smaller and smaller.&nbsp; Also, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen so much styrofoam, which is resused from what we could see.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/49-141089326_940b3a687b.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;No matter, the Tsukiji Market is not to be missed on a trip to Tokyo, just be prepared to wake up at 5am to see the action.&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/karaoke" title="Roppongi Nightlife and Karaoke">Roppongi Nightlife and Karaoke</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on May 5, 2006 - 12:06am</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>We have to admit that the movie &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; has left an indelible mark on our expectations of what your supposed to do in Tokyo. There is surely no better place on earth to experience the karaoke phenomenon and last night we repeated the experience of the characters in the movie and rented a karaoke cube for two hours- from about 1:15-3:15AM at a cost of US$58 including a drink and two dishes of gyoza. (Karaoke is singing along to music videos you choose.) </p><p>Of course, you can&#39;t fully experience karoake without a few drinks, so we also went to have dinner and take part the famous Roppongi nightlife.&nbsp; Once again, Sachi&#39;s japanese skills enabled us to find restaurants that do not cater to foreigners and have menus that look like this:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-140675751_1f8355afdc.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>We had sashimi.&nbsp;</p><p>Roppongi is known as a place where foreigners go for nightlife and there are hundreds of bars, taking up the first 5 stories of real estate for many blocks.&nbsp; For some surreal atomsphere- we went to a reggae bar (in Tokyo remember), where I played darts with a guy named &quot;Hide&quot;. Later we went to the Motown Bar, where I couldn&#39;t believe the popularity of the Mexican beer Corona and the number of attentive bartenders. The service in Tokyo is amazing.<br /></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/46-140675578_d8fe3de876.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Having sufficiently found new courage, we were ready for karaoke, which I have to admit was very, very fun.&nbsp; I think Seattle needs a karaoke cube joint.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/47-140675611_379f4b3c0c.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/51-140675663_9e93c7e647.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Here are selection of the songs we sang:</p><ul><li>Sitting on the Dock of the Bay - Otis Redding</li><li>Pretty Woman -&nbsp; Roy Orbison</li><li>You Give Love A Bad Name - Bon Jovi</li><li>I Will Survive - Gloria Gaynor</li><li>Sweet Caroline - Neil Diamond</li><li>Sexual Healing - Marvin Gaye</li><li>Dancing Queen - AbbA</li><li>My Life - Billy Joel</li><li>King of the Road - Roger Miller</li></ul><p>&nbsp;Inquirys should be directed to our agent. </p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on May 3, 2006 - 5:41pm</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p><a href="http://gen.kanai.net/">Gen Kanai</a> is a Japanese New Yorker who has been living in Tokyo for about 3 years.&nbsp; In fact, he grew up within a couple of blocks from the Murray Hill neighborhood where we stayed in <a href="/47/dispatch/2005/12/13/on-location-new-york">New York in December.</a></p><p>Anyway, Gen and I know some of the same folks and when plans were made to visit Tokyo, we made plans to meet Gen there.&nbsp; Last night we went out to a very nice and tasty tempura restaurant called Ginza Tenkuni, which has been around since 1885. More on the food in a minute.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-140015832_905e34086b.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>What excited me was learning about the Japanese gadgetry.&nbsp; First, we met at the Apple store in the Ginza district and used their computers to find a restaurant.&nbsp; Then, Gen put the restaurant&#39;s phone number into his GPS-enabled phone.&nbsp; From that point, the phone guided us to the restaurant with voice commands as we walked through Ginza.&nbsp; In Japanese, the voice from the phone would say &quot;In 50 meters, turn right&quot;. I was very impressed.&nbsp; Also, did you know that the Japanese don&#39;t use SMS (short message/chat)?&nbsp; They use email for mobile text communications. This is the mobile GPS system...</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/45-140015866_968861c313.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Once we got to the restaurant, it was obvious that we had entered a very fine and traditional tempura house, which is a bit like a high class sushi bar, but only serving seafood and vegetables fried in a light batter. The quality of food was equalled by the japanese service and ambience that could be described as beautiful. The experience was quite a treat.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-140015899_c126c5d6bb.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>One of the dishes I had never had was the fried shrimp legs.&nbsp; They were better than they sound- further proving my point that frying anything makes it better. :)&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/54-140015934_45f83ccf6e.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;We owe a big thanks to Gen for his hospitality.&nbsp;  </p><br class="clear" />

  <p>I was telling Sachi today about my excitement about Tokyo and Japan in general. I told her that it feels like a first date that is going really well- so well that I&#39;m already looking forward to the next date. Maybe I have a crush on Tokyo.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-139622676_17603fbbcd.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>I&#39;ve mentioned before that I enjoy visiting places that feel other-worldly.&nbsp; Usually it is landscapes that give me this feeling, but with Tokyo it is the cityscape and the people.

The young Japanese folks have a fashion sense that most Americans would consider over-the-top.&nbsp; It seems that all the rage lately among the teenager girls is what I would call &quot;Little Bo Peep&quot; style.&nbsp; I can&#39;t say I&#39;m a fan.&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/45-139623013_ea9a4acd63.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;And these with the industry-standard &quot;peace&quot; signs...</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/52-139622934_9a6af12c92.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;One of the sights we set out to see today was the Shibuya Crosswalk, which is famous for the hordes of people who cross it all day.&nbsp; TruthChild hooked us up on the <a href="/47/blog/truthchild/cant-get-enough-of-japan">best place to watch</a> (2nd story Starbucks) and was fun to see, though it is a holiday and liklely had less people than usual.

It is only possible to purchase a JR Pass *outside* of Japan and we planned to buy them in Bangkok. We carefully planned our time in Bangkok to have a weekday for acquiring said pass.  As noted previously, the May Day holiday through a monkey wrench into the plan- all travel agencies were closed.<br /><br /> So, this morning the goal was to take the SkyTrain at rush hour (with our backpacks), find the travel agency somewhere on the busy Silom Rd. that opened at 8:30, get the pass and make our 11am flight to Tokyo, JR Pass in hand.  Delays in getting the pass or traffic could have caused us to miss the flight and not getting the JR would have cost us hundreds of dollars extra in travel. Stakes were high.<br /><br /> Things this morning went hurriedly, sweatily and luckily quite smoothly and here we are with our boarding pass and JR Pass safely in hand, ready for Tokyo.<br /><br /> One quick note:  We were amazed and a bit worried when we tried to board the first train this morning.  The doors opened to reveal people packed in like sardines- you could see that the opening of the doors gave them a little relief.  We looked in there, then at our backpacks, and let that train go.  When the next one came, I remembered watching the <a href="/dispatch/2006/03/20/the-sport-of-rush-hour-train-boarding-in-mumbai-india">men board the train in Mumbai, India</a> and as soon as the doors opened, we pushed in and made room for ourselves, much to the dismay of the man behind Sachi, who pushed her for the rest of the eerily silent ride.  If nothing else, we&#39;re becoming more aware of what it means to give up person space to things done. </p><br class="clear" />
