  <p>The train trip has exceeded our expectations in a big way.  The train itself is OK, but Mongolia and Siberia have been highlights of the whole trip, except for my saddle sores.  Unfortunately though, it's a bit harder to upload all the pictures, videos, etc. Once we get into the big cities like Moscow we'll be sharing a lot more. Here is quick video to get started...</p>

  <p>We are&nbsp; about to begin the first legs of the Trans-Siberian Railway, first stop: Ulan Baatarr, Mongolia, where we will spend two nights at a Ger Camp (I&#39;m not really sure either).&nbsp; We are both so very excited - this trip marks the end of Asia and the beginning of perhaps the most anticipated journey of the year. Woo hoo!&nbsp; Here&#39;s the plan:</p><ul><li>September 9<sup>th</sup>: Depart <st1:place><st1:city>Beijing</st1:city>,  <st1:country-region>China</st1:country-region></st1:place> </li><li>September 10<sup>th</sup>:<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:city>Ulanbaatar</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Mongolia</st1:country-region></st1:place> (2 nights plus travel)</li><li>September 14<sup>th</sup>: <span>&nbsp;</span><st1:place><st1:city>Irkutsk</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Russia</st1:country-region></st1:place> (Lake Baikal-Siberia) (2 nights plus travel)</li><li>September 18<sup>th</sup>: <st1:place><st1:city>Ekaterinburg</st1:city>,  <st1:country-region>Russia</st1:country-region></st1:place> (Urals) (2 nights plus travel)</li><li>September 21st:<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:city>Moscow</st1:city>,  <st1:country-region>Russia</st1:country-region></st1:place> (2 nights plus travel)</li><li>September 24th:<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>St.   Petersburg</st1:place></st1:city> (3 nights)</li><li>September 27th:<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:city>Helsinki</st1:city>,  <st1:country-region>Finland</st1:country-region></st1:place></li></ul><p>Of course, this also marks the end of China, which has been amazing in so many ways - mostly unexpected.

Amazing. </p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on September 7, 2006 - 6:54pm</div>
    <div class="content">
  <p>&nbsp;I have a bad attitude sometimes, particularly regarding sightseeing and the tourist experience.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s a necessary and often rewarding part of the trip, but we&rsquo;re both learning that we don&rsquo;t really <i>like </i>sightseeing.<span>&nbsp; </span>It often seems like the many of the things we see are significant because someone with dollars in their eyes decided to make it significant.<span>&nbsp; </span>Either that, or the significance that is experienced by others is lost on me.  </p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Maybe I am shallow or cynical or unsophisticated, but I will be just fine if I don&rsquo;t see another &ldquo;important&rdquo; image of The Buddha for many years.<span>&nbsp; </span>The same is true for many temples.<span>&nbsp; </span>Long before we reached <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, we started to recognize that we rarely leave a temple saying &ldquo;<i>that was so great!</i>&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>or &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m so glad we came!</i>&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>Usually it&rsquo;s more like &ldquo;Hmm, another temple.&rdquo; We call it temple fatigue.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Another example occurred just today at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Summer</st1:placename>  <st1:placetype>Palace</st1:placetype></st1:place> in <st1:city><st1:place>Beijing</st1:place></st1:city>, which is, by all accounts, an impressive sight of imperial grandeur.<span>&nbsp; </span>Inside the palace grounds (and also in the Forbidden City) there are very important rocks with names like the &ldquo;Blue Iris Stone&rdquo; which are accompanied by a story of an who emperor found the rock and had it shipped to the Palace at great expense.<span>&nbsp; </span>So there it sits, surrounded by a railing and sitting on a pedestal &ndash; a rock.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s not sculpted, it&rsquo;s not shaped, it has never been used for anything or changed in any way, it may be in the shape of something recognizable and is certainly a rockish, yellow/gray hue (despite being described as &ldquo;black and sleek&rdquo;).<span>&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that it is a rock that someone could have found at any moment in history and is one of about 1 gazillion such rocks in the world. To the admittedly undereducated like myself, it appears just as it sounds &ndash; a rock &ndash; on a pedestal - surrounded by a railing. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I&rsquo;m not sure how a rock becomes an item of Chinese culture, but many have and people quite literally line up to have their picture taken in front of it.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><font size="4"><img src="/files/includes/images/lockers-cox_f-images-china2006-china20063.jpg" border="0" height="362" width="520" /></font></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><i>(photo of the Blue Iris Stone is from <a href="http://www.soil.ncsu.edu/lockers/Cox_F/China%20tour%202006.htm">this travelouge</a>) &nbsp;</i></p><p class="MsoNormal">I have to wonder though, am I being cynical and shallow or am I being realistic?<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;ve seen it happen before in tour groups &ndash; the guide makes a big hairy deal about something and the group eats it up and prepares the cameras without thought.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is where the tourist experience blends a little too closely with dollar signs.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tour groups need sights and the more the tourist is convinced that they are seeing something significant, the more likely they&rsquo;ll actually find some significance.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, from my perspective, a strong percentage of what a tourist sees is filler &ndash; something to make the tourist feel like they are having a great experience in between the things that are really impressive and important to them. <span>&nbsp;</span>I think this gets to the heart of why I loath tour groups &ndash; too much filler and not enough time to independently figure out what is significant to me. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The tour guide is very in tune with photo taking opportunities as well. He has surely observed the hoards take pictures of a sight and assumes that everyone should have one &ndash; including me. Sometimes I snap a quick picture just to make friends but at the same time I&rsquo;m thinking &ldquo;<i>If you really want to know what I want to take a picture of, it&rsquo;s the grotesque and barely alive condition of <b>your toenails</b>, Mr. Tour Guide.&rdquo;</i></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">It reminds me of <st1:city><st1:place>Las Vegas</st1:place></st1:city> and seeing people very excited to take a picture of a replica of Michael Angelo&rsquo;s masterpiece &ldquo;David&rdquo; at Caesar&rsquo;s Palace.<span>&nbsp; </span>I just want to say to them &ldquo;<i>That is not art you know, it is not historically significant, it is a piece of plaster put here for decoration alone</i>.&rdquo; But it doesn&rsquo;t matter, they think it&rsquo;s great and who am I to judge?</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">All this is leading to the realization that I don&rsquo;t like sightseeing.<span>&nbsp; </span>I yearn for reality or a historical and observable connection to the reality of a city or country. Modern history is endlessly fascinating.<span>&nbsp; </span>The spread of Communism in <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>, Mao Zedong, Pol Pol, Ho Chi Minh&hellip; I cannot learn enough about that part of history.<span>&nbsp; </span>Anything before about 1900 becomes somewhat opaque to me.<span>&nbsp; </span>I can&rsquo;t see as much reality in it or how it is affecting a country now.<span>&nbsp; </span>What really does it for me is learning the modern realities of a place &ndash; the politics, the social issues, the transportation system, food, what locals do, say and wear day-to-day.<span>&nbsp; </span>For me, this is endlessly real and represents something that I can grasp in my view of the world. Rocks and temples?<span>&nbsp; </span>Not so much.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I will gladly continue to see sights and learn about history, but I&rsquo;ll do it recognizing that there is a curiously real, entertaining and interesting aspect of tourism and tourists that can be quite rewarding to observe, even if the sights are not.</p>    <br class="clear" />

On the streets of <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, you might recognize Bob on a hot day by his exposed belly &ndash; he may be the one walking around with his shirt rolled up from the bottom or unbuttoned completely.<span>&nbsp; </span><br /><img src="/files/includes/images/62-223705747_41b584d6ff.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The one tried-and-true method of identifying Chinese Bob is by his footwear.<span>&nbsp; </span>Bob always wears the same shoes and socks.<span>&nbsp; </span>They are pointy-toed dress shoes with very thin, light-colored socks.<span>&nbsp; </span>You might even see Bob wear these shoes with athletic shorts as he ambles down the street with his posture laid back and his feet flopping forward.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/67-216459407_d09568a382.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">The other sure way to identify Chinese Bob is by watching him talk on a mobile phone.<span>&nbsp; </span>Actually, it&rsquo;s not something you observe so much as hear.<span>&nbsp; </span>Bob will seem to be yelling into his mobile phone without regard for his location. You can picture him saying &ldquo;<i>BIG BUSINESS HERE.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m talking BIG business everyone, BIG TIME.</i>&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>Bob is quite a big talker, I imagine.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I also imagine that Bob is a family man and a dedicated worker.<span>&nbsp; </span>Despite his foreignness and actions that sometimes seem repulsive to me, I know that Chinese Bob, if I could talk to him, would be a friendly and helpful person who might try to convince me to have a cigarette with him as he tells me about English football, Yao Ming and the upcoming Beijing Olympics.<span>&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately though, I don&rsquo;t speak Mandarin Chinese so I can only assume that, on observation alone, he finds me equally or more foreign and strange.</p>  <br class="clear" />

    <div class="content">
  <p>I&#39;m a little conflicted about Shanghai after spending about 10 days there. Without a doubt, it is an amazingly modern, shiny, commercially-oriented city that is becoming a 21st century New York City or Hong Kong.&nbsp; It&#39;s alive with energy and fun.&nbsp; However, I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it, but it feels like something is missing.&nbsp; Sometimes I feel like Shanghai has no heart. </p><p>For the traveler, Shanghai offers only glimpses of old Shanghai.&nbsp; Everyday the old parts of the city are being bulldozed to make room for skyscrapers and shopping centers. Shanghai is not a place to reflect on the past, but consider the future.&nbsp; Modern commercialism is alive and well in Shanghai and it sometimes beats you over the head.&nbsp; As a Dutch guy we met put it &quot;I feel like a walking wallet in Shanghai&quot;. Indeed.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/76-225716135_f8c3714965.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Many times we&#39;ve discussed how China is more like a young country than an ancient one.&nbsp; Some say that it is only about 20 years old because the Mao&#39;s Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) essentially erased all things Chinese. I think this is the case with Shanghai - it is like a teenager who is working hard to find the identity that will define them as an adult.&nbsp; The symbol of this adolescence to me is the Pearl City Tower.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/81-225715964_ac5b1665f7.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;The tower was built in 1994 and I imagine that it was to be a symbol of a city that is focused on the future.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I think the tower looks less like the future and more like what people thought the future would look like in 1950.&nbsp; With garish pink glass and blinking colored lights at night, the tower appears dated and conflicts with the elegance found elsewhere in the city. I chalk it up to a teenage &quot;phase&quot;.</p><p>The elegance I refer to can be found in the same picture above on the right - the 88 story JinMao tower. One of the top 5 tallest buildings in the world and built four years after the Pearl City, I consider one of the most beautiful skyscrapers I&#39;ve seen.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/91-233326710_2fe650e9fd.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>And the inside is equally as impressive - especially the highest hotel in the world, the Grand Hyatt Shanghai.&nbsp; The hotel starts on the 56th floor and reaches 33 stories to the top, including a dizzying atrium the whole way up.&nbsp; We checked- rooms cost about US$240 and it&#39;s located in Pudong- a business district.  </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/48-230788723_d5ba9086a5.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;One of Shanghai&#39;s proud possessions is a what is called the &quot;fastest train in the world&quot; called the <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/shanghai-maglev-train">MagLev (Magnetic Levetation)</a>.&nbsp; We were a little disappointed because the top operational speed is supposed to be 429 kph (267 mph) but our train only got to 301 kph (the speed is displayed inside).&nbsp; Still impressive, but I think we were a little spoiled by the <a href="/47/shinkansen">Japanese Shinkansen</a>, which offers a much smoother ride, despite not floating on air.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/75-230786979_c9bce15148.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;If you get a chance, I sincerely recommend getting a haircut in another country.&nbsp; It offers a truly local experience.&nbsp; I chose to go to a place that was a bit more stylish than I would at home, but it was worth it (US$8).&nbsp; Approximately 75% of the time I spent there, I was being massaged, which was a total surprise - all I needed was clippers and I could do the haircut myself.&nbsp; As <a href="http://www.justagwailo.com/">Richard</a> mentioned - this photo looks like I&#39;m being mercilessly attacked with a machete. It&#39;s just an arm massage. </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/58-229652030_fdeab3036a.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;The Shanghai folks are surely the most stylish in China that we have seen and just as concerned with the darkening effects of the sun as others in Asia, where whitening creams are advertised everywhere.&nbsp; The photo below was taken in the sun- not the rain.&nbsp; All the umbrellas are for the sun and represent a giant hazard to my eyes.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/74-229651109_5f5d9dcb1f.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Despite some of my mixed feelings, I really did enjoy the time in Shanghai and would go back in a second.&nbsp; I suppose I just had different expectations. It is clear from being there that it is a city of the future.&nbsp; What Shanghai will become and how they deal with things like air quality is going to be very interesting. &nbsp;</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/90-233326768_6a4f50085f.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><br class="clear" />
