    <div class="info">By: leelefever on January 2, 2007 - 4:11pm</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>For the past year, TwinF has been our baby, our home, our object of interest and we are quickly approaching the day when we stop writing here.&nbsp; In fact, we have decided to <b>close the site this coming Saturday, January 6th</b> - exactly one year from the day we left Hawaii for New Zealand.&nbsp; From that point on it will be frozen in time - no new updates.&nbsp; Between now and then, we plan to post lists of our favorite things - photos, videos, experiences, countries etc.&nbsp; It should be fun. </p><p>It&#39;s a sad moment for us, really.&nbsp; We have had such a great time with the site and it&#39;s connection to you as our online companion. It&#39;s hard to let go and I&#39;ll miss it, really and truly. The connection will end here, but it will sprout in other places, where we&#39;ll continue to live online in one form or another.&nbsp; </p><p>For those of you who want to continue to keep up with us through my writing, photos, videos, etc., tune into <a href="http://www.leelefever.com/">Lee LeFever dot com</a>.&nbsp; I&#39;ve already started blogging a little there and it will turn into our personal home on the Web.&nbsp; In fact, I&#39;m committing myself to posting one picture per day to the site for all of 2007.&nbsp; Don&#39;t expect to be impressed on a daily basis. :) &nbsp;</p><p>If you&#39;re interested in our consulting business, it has also come back out of &quot;hibernation&quot; to give our business a home on the web once again. See: <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/">Commmon Craft - Social Design for the Web</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, keep an eye out for our favorites and other goodies coming your way soon.&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/boomchicago" title="Me, MySpace and iPod: Delightfully Geeky">Me, MySpace and iPod: Delightfully Geeky</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on October 12, 2006 - 8:17am</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>I knew it would be interesting at least- a standup/improv comedy troupe called <a href="http://www.boomchicago.nl/">Boom Chicago</a> doing a show called &quot;Me, MySpace and iPod&quot;.&nbsp; As it turned out, it was completely up my alley and I was very impressed. </p><p>It was the first I had seen a comedy routine integrated with technology and social networking - something very close to <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/">my job</a> when I&#39;m not traveling.&nbsp; </p><p>For instance, they asked the audience who had a page on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace.com</a> and someone was chosen for the skit. They went to the live site during the show to check out the guy&#39;s page and asked him about some friends on his friend&#39;s list.&nbsp; Then, later in the show they did a whole routine that brought his MySpace friends to life based on his descriptions.&nbsp; So freaking funny - and for the skit to work every night they have to find someone in the audience with a MySpace page - in Amsterdam. This goes to show how huge MySpace is.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/94-267894941_b4320ead1d.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>They also did a skit based on <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/">Wikipedia</a>, which is an online encyclopedia that a very large community of people manage by editing pages.&nbsp; Wikipedia works, but is also famous for disagreements about how an entry should be written.&nbsp; In the skit, they ask for an object, in this case a pineapple and they take turns describing it in encyclopedic style.&nbsp; When one performer disagrees, they yell &quot;EDIT!&quot; and it becomes their turn to create the &quot;real&quot; definition.&nbsp; Wiki-based humor, wow.</p><p>Being that we are in Amsterdam, they also parodied Anne Frank and showed a YouTube style video blog that was done by Anne Frank back on the 1940&#39;s [<a href="http://www.boomchicago.nl/en/news-and-images/videos/index.cfm?i=2513">watch the video</a>].&nbsp; It was a take-off of the now-famous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ87kBN0Nhk">LonelyGirl15 on You Tube</a>.</p><p>I was in awe. It was funny yes, but what really blew me away was that these websites and ideas were too geeky for prime time only a couple of years ago and now, suddenly, it is mainstream enough to become fodder for an entire comedy show.&nbsp; If I was running a technology conference, I would hire Boom Chicago in a second. </p><br class="clear" />

  <p>We're temporarily at the house where I grew up in Kernersville, NC with my parents.&nbsp; We're just about to leave for a road trip around the southeast to see friends.</p><p>I'm struck today, when I'm supposed to be relaxing at home,&nbsp;by&nbsp;my compulsion to check email, blog, upload pictures to Flickr and basically keep up with my online life.&nbsp; I need to slow this trend down.</p><p>I think that I haven't really stopped working at all.&nbsp; All the deliverables from my normal work world have been transitioned to to-dos on the trip.&nbsp; I am drawn to fill gaps of relaxing by thinking about what I could do on the computer, even as I sacrifice more trip oriented activities.&nbsp; I couldn't wait to have the feeling of not working, but it seems inescapable.&nbsp; </p><p>As we said from the very beginning, we want to have a good trip more than a good web site and I have to keep that in mind.&nbsp; Of course, I realize that I'm practicing that which I criticize about myself&nbsp;at this moment- it just feels good I suppose.</p><br class="clear" />

  <p>Planning a trip like this is an amazing experience, both for the building excitement and fun and for the amount of loose ends that must be tied up.&nbsp; It reminds me of the Beck lyric from the song <a href="http://www.lyricsondemand.com/b/becklyrics/jackasslyrics.html" target="_self">Jack Ass</a>:</p><p><span class="blockquote">Loose ends tying a noose in the back of my mind&nbsp; </span>It's not quite a noose, but the list is quickly growing and shrinking every day.&nbsp; Think about paying taxes... We're leaving on December 11th, long before our tax statements come in.&nbsp; We're leaving before our year even comes to a close.&nbsp; Dealing with taxes is a big deal for us and yesterday we spend most of the day sorting through receipts and the Common Craft revenues and expenses in preparation for a meeting with our accountant.</p><p>What we plan to do is have a big envelope ready and have Mark put any mail that looks tax-related in it and have it sent to the accountant before texes are due.&nbsp; <br /> </p><p>&nbsp;<img width="500" height="375" onload="show_notes_initially()" alt="" src="/files/includes/images/24-62882255_fc48570659.jpg-v-0.jpg" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Common Craft is a whole other pain.&nbsp; It just occurred to me last week that I have a number of annual renewals and payments I usually make in the Spring.&nbsp; Business License renewal, Excise tax, Seattle City Business Tax, etc. I had to call the offices and get special forms for renewing and paying early.</p><p>This is all in the name of more peace of mind.&nbsp; The more we can do now, the less we'll have to worry about next year and that is a good thing.<br /> </p><br class="clear" />
