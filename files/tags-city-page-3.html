    <div class="info">By: leelefever on May 3, 2006 - 5:41pm</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p><a href="http://gen.kanai.net/">Gen Kanai</a> is a Japanese New Yorker who has been living in Tokyo for about 3 years.&nbsp; In fact, he grew up within a couple of blocks from the Murray Hill neighborhood where we stayed in <a href="/47/dispatch/2005/12/13/on-location-new-york">New York in December.</a></p><p>Anyway, Gen and I know some of the same folks and when plans were made to visit Tokyo, we made plans to meet Gen there.&nbsp; Last night we went out to a very nice and tasty tempura restaurant called Ginza Tenkuni, which has been around since 1885. More on the food in a minute.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-140015832_905e34086b.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>What excited me was learning about the Japanese gadgetry.&nbsp; First, we met at the Apple store in the Ginza district and used their computers to find a restaurant.&nbsp; Then, Gen put the restaurant&#39;s phone number into his GPS-enabled phone.&nbsp; From that point, the phone guided us to the restaurant with voice commands as we walked through Ginza.&nbsp; In Japanese, the voice from the phone would say &quot;In 50 meters, turn right&quot;. I was very impressed.&nbsp; Also, did you know that the Japanese don&#39;t use SMS (short message/chat)?&nbsp; They use email for mobile text communications. This is the mobile GPS system...</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/45-140015866_968861c313.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Once we got to the restaurant, it was obvious that we had entered a very fine and traditional tempura house, which is a bit like a high class sushi bar, but only serving seafood and vegetables fried in a light batter. The quality of food was equalled by the japanese service and ambience that could be described as beautiful. The experience was quite a treat.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-140015899_c126c5d6bb.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>One of the dishes I had never had was the fried shrimp legs.&nbsp; They were better than they sound- further proving my point that frying anything makes it better. :)&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/54-140015934_45f83ccf6e.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;We owe a big thanks to Gen for his hospitality.&nbsp;  </p><br class="clear" />

  <p>I was telling Sachi today about my excitement about Tokyo and Japan in general. I told her that it feels like a first date that is going really well- so well that I&#39;m already looking forward to the next date. Maybe I have a crush on Tokyo.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-139622676_17603fbbcd.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>I&#39;ve mentioned before that I enjoy visiting places that feel other-worldly.&nbsp; Usually it is landscapes that give me this feeling, but with Tokyo it is the cityscape and the people. There is surely no other place like Tokyo in the world.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/56-139632535_7fb2d46336.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>All the places we&#39;ve been before here felt like going back in time to more traditional lifestyles and fashions.&nbsp; Visiting Tokyo is like going into the future where things have evolved in their own indepedent way- including every convenience one could image.</p><p>The Japanese have a style that is all their own. The young Japanese folks have a fashion sense that most Americans would consider over-the-top.&nbsp; It seems that all the rage lately among the teenager girls is what I would call &quot;Little Bo Peep&quot; style.&nbsp; I can&#39;t say I&#39;m a fan.&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/45-139623013_ea9a4acd63.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;And these with the industry-standard &quot;peace&quot; signs...</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/52-139622934_9a6af12c92.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;One of the sights we set out to see today was the Shibuya Crosswalk, which is famous for the hordes of people who cross it all day.&nbsp; TruthChild hooked us up on the <a href="/47/blog/truthchild/cant-get-enough-of-japan">best place to watch</a> (2nd story Starbucks) and was fun to see, though it is a holiday and liklely had less people than usual.

	After a quite gruelling trip from Delhi, we've made it to Bangkok.  We're both in good health but recovering a bit.  Here's how NOT to fly from Delhi to Bangkok...<br /><br />
-Leave Delhi at 11:30pm<br /><br />
-Arrive Colombo, Sri Lanka 3:00am<br /><br />
-Attempt to sleep in airport till 7am<br /><br />
-Depart Colombo 8am<br /><br />
-Arrive Bangkok 12noon<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Sri Lankan Airlines is a great airline, but man connecting through Colombo is a hassle.  Sometimes cheap fares cost more than money.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
So far we haven't seen much in Bangkok outside of Siam Square, which is a big shopping area.  It's already quite a contrast from Sri Lanka and India.  A few of the biggest things so far are::<br /><br />
-The driving is quite orderly<br /><br />
-There are equal numbers of men and women in public<br /><br />
- Being in public is less of a hassle<br /><br />
- It's freaking HOT<br /><br />
<br /><br />
We have the Treo 650 working here, so blogging, checking email, etc.  should be easy.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If you'd like to call us on your dime, our number is: (country code: 66) 095131621.  We dare u. :) We'll put it on the Contant Us page too.

  <p>We're zig-zagging our way across the Indian Ocean, thanks to favorable air fares.&nbsp; From Sri Lanka, we went back to Singapore and took a cheap bus to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where we've been for a few days.&nbsp; &quot;KL&quot; as everyone calls it is OK, but not my favorite place.&nbsp; The food has been awesome and it's super cheap, but it's a huge city with less character than I imagined.&nbsp; The next time in Malaysia, we'll do the non-city tour for sure.</p><p>&nbsp;We're staying in China Town at a place called the &quot;<a href="http://www.chinatowninn.com/">Hotel Chinatown Inn</a>&quot; which is perfect for us - recommended.&nbsp; $28US per night, perfect central location, AC, etc.&nbsp; They have late check out too, which we need badly today.</p><p>There is a Formula One race starting tomorrow that I wish we could see, but we're heading to Mumbai India tonight, which should be an amazing experience.&nbsp; India is considered to be one of the hardest places to travel, so I think we'll be challenged a bit- but it will be really interesting and we're both excited.</p><p>Suddenly yesterday, both of our ATM cards stopped working and we spent this morning trying to reach Bank of America to get it all set.&nbsp; It's funny how hard things can be sometimes.</p><p>I hope to have the Treo working again to be able to do some moble blogging from India, which I miss greatly.&nbsp; </p><br class="clear" />
