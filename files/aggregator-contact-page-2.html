<div class="feed-item-meta"><a href="/aggregator/sources/35" class="feed-item-source">Now on LeeLeFever.com</a> - <span class="feed-item-date">January 27, 2007 - 10:58am</span></div>
<div class="feed-item-body">For a while now we've shared our home with Mark, Sachi's brother. He did us a huge favor in living in our home while we were gone and taking care of our dog.  Fortunately for us, the favors just keep coming.  You see, Mark has a penchant for charity auctions. While we were gone he bid on a few days at a condo (and lift tickets) at Mt. Baker, an amazing ski/snowboard mountain north of Seattle.



So, ya know, we had to help him with the fruits of his winnings, you know, for charity. So we spent a few days up there recently.  



Mt. Baker usually gets pounded with snow in the winter.  In fact it holds the world record for <a href="http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases99/aug99/noaa99056.html">annual snowfall</a> (1,140 inches).  It is a family-owned ski area since the 60's and retains a family charm that attracts a lot fo locals.  There is no "resort".  In fact, you have to drive for about 20 minutes to get to the closest accomodation.  Mt. Baker is also famous for the lengendary <a href="http://expn.go.com/bankedslalom/2002/s/history.html">Banked Slalom snowboard race</a> where pros come from around the world to join the locals in a race for the duct tape trophy.  Mt. Baker is also known for excellent backcountry terrain.



However, when we were there we saw rain one day and sun the next.  The area is no stranger to rain of course and it makes for an other-worldly scene where everything is covered with thick moss.  Even after out trip, there are few places that appeal to me more than the forest of the great NW.  We stayed along the Nooksack River.







Thanks Mark!</div>

<div class="feed-item-body">Our house has been a wreck, at least in a couple of rooms near the door where we’ve piled all things unwanted.  Bags of old clothes, a box of old speakers, an old shelf stereo and various miscellany.  As I kept reminding Sachi – look at all this stuff!  We’ll never have to move it again!  Indeed, this is liberating.Today we nearly packed the back of the truck full with unwanted and mostly un-ebay-able items and gave it away to Goodwill.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leelefever/362718420/">Off to Vancouver BC</a> 
Posted from Lee's Mobile Phone. 
We tried to do this last week and it was  good thing we didn't because we felt like we looked: sick.  No one wants to see that.
So we're finally on our way to see our friends in the great white north (about 3 hours from Seattle).  Vancouver is always a good time with the company of the folks from Bryght, Rain City, Hop Studios, etc.  We're both geeked out about hanging out with everyone tonight at the "<a href="http://upcoming.org/event/139555">Lee and Sachi meet up</a>, as it is called.  If you're reading this from Vancouver, come on out....</div>

<div class="feed-item-meta"><a href="/aggregator/sources/35" class="feed-item-source">Now on LeeLeFever.com</a> - <span class="feed-item-date">January 16, 2007 - 9:08pm</span></div>
<div class="feed-item-body">It snowed again last night - an inch or so, and by about 3pm, it was melting.  However, this did not stop the kids on snow day from continuing to behave as if, indeed, Seattle is perfectly at home with snow on the ground.  Case in point:

I saw a group of kids rolling something big and dirty down the street and had to investigate.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leelefever/360217861/" title="Photo Sharing"></a>

Despite the rapid melting of snow, these courageous kids had worked to create the most ginormous snowball I have seen in a long time.  At least I think it was snow... and leaves... and rocks.  Somewhere in Mt. Baker there must be about 2 square acres completely devoid of snow and other yard items.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leelefever/360218120/" title="Photo Sharing"></a>

I didn't ask where they were going with it or where it came from, but I assume it's the mid section of a much larger gray and leafy snow monster down the street somewhere.  I've got to hand it to them for making the best of what was barely enough snow for fun on any scale.</div>

<div class="feed-item-body">It's all Mark's fault really.  Over a week ago he got sick in the cold variety and then of the intestinal sort.  I followed soon after, starting on Wednesday and through today (Sunday).  Today was a transition from one type to the other.  Sachi has seemingly skipped a step and gone directly to the intestinal sort.  All this has provided us time to be home while it is cold as hell outside, and still icy.

Amusing Amos with various mindgames, working,  building fires and TV have made our collective sicknesses bearable. Oh, and Netflix.  In the last couple of days we watched "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427944/">Thank You For Smoking</a>" and the Enron documentary "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413845/">The Smartest Guys in the Room</a>".  Both quite enjoyable in a "is this what the world has come to?" sort of way.  

Thank You For Not Smoking is a satirical story about a guy who is the public face of the Big Tobacco lobby - the chief lobbyist representing the tobacco companies.  I've enjoyed it much more in retrospect than during viewing time.  It's a sad story about a guy who has found that he is very skilled and his finest skills are used most productively as a lobbyist for a product that kills millions of Americans.  For me though, it is a story about the power of spin - a person's ability to verbally distort an issue so that appears as something different, regardless of fact.  He is a master and, while I don't aspire to spin, I think there are lessons to be learned about the skill of argument and reason.

The movie started a discussion between Sachi and I about argument and she produced a book that she recently described as "the most valuable book she owns".  It's called, and this is a window into Sachi's deceptively serious and nerdy world, "Current Issues and Enduring Questions - Methods and Modes of Argument" by Sylvan Barnet and Hugo Bedau.  Indeed, it outlines the basics of argument and is mostly made up of classic arguments by famous intellectuals.  Example: Steven Jay Gould on "Does Evolution Refute Creationism?"

It's not light stuff, but I find myself wanting to read more.  I want to be better at productive and responsible arguement. Unfortunately, for now at least, blowing my nose seems to be my greatest and most productive and skill.</div>

<div class="feed-item-body"><a href="/files/includes/images/entry-178902xl.jpg"></a>As part of our readjustment to the real world, we’re taking a harder look at the things we have- possessions that are mostly useless – and getting rid of them. I think the trip gave us a little perspective regarding the things we really <strong>need</strong>.The first things to go were clothes.  We now have about 6 large trash bags of clothes ready for Goodwill.  I’m thinking of adopting a strategy where no new clothes come into the closet until something comes out. I still think I have too many coats/jackets.Purging books left me a little conflicted, but I got over it.  I think some people have a problem letting go of books, and I’m sure true biliophiles would shudder at the ease with which we let them go.  Now we now have stacks of them ready for someone else and clean, clear shelves. This has me wondering now if I’d rather have empty shelves or not?  Maybe I need to collect something.  Wait, I’m trying to get rid of things.  Empty shelves will do fine for now.  Plus, one shelf makes for a perfect den for our pet dragon, which, if you’re interest, we totally need for protection.See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/leelefever?on=6059497">get rid of unnecessary possessions</a></div>

<div class="feed-item-body">Since we’ve gotten home from our trip, home has taken on a new and different feeling.  First, since Sachi is now working with me on <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/">Common Craft</a>, we both work from home. This being the case, we have agreed to make home an even more inviting, healthy and comfortable environment.  If we’re gonna be here all the time, we might as well make it exactly what we want.When I say that I want to “Blend work and home life” I mean to make my life one life, one schedule, one to-do list, one whole.  I learned on a project once that executives who have only one calendar that stretches across home and work are happier because they see their work life and home life as working together.  The less happy ones live in two worlds: work and home. In this case they constantly have competing priorities. I don’t want two worlds and blending home and work life is my first step.See more progress on: <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/leelefever?on=6059263">blend work and home life</a></div>

<div class="feed-item-body">Like we've done before, Sachi and I are taking a few swing dancing classes.  Like most other classes, you end up dancing with everyone there and small talk inevitably ensues in the 1-2 minutes you spend with each person.  Sachi was dancing with an older gentleman who asked if she lives in the neighborhood.  She said yes and he said that he used to live up the street.  As it turns out, this guy and his wife lived in our very house from 1975-1980.  What a small world. </div>

I wasn't much of a professional football fan before, but Mark, my brother-in-law has season tickets and he has helped to convert me into a screaming and cursing - but not yet face-painting, fan.  Part of the attraction, admittedly, is the amazing tailgate session of which he is a working part.  I've not seen anything like it. It includes a school bus that is equipped with a beer tap and an attachment on the front that holds a grill.

The whole group strives for the "wow factor" which manifests itself in, for today anyway, a foosball table, a mini ping-pong table and more ways to consume alcohol than you can shake a stick at- all under the Alaskan Way Viaduct near downtown Seattle. 
(edited, Lee,  1/06)
A tradition that doesn't quiet appeal to me is that of shotgunning beers before the game.  I've never been good at it, even as a college student, and I stay away from it now, even though it seems to be a popular tailgate event regardless of age.
I write this post with a fading and gravelley voice, which is the badge of honor among members of Seattle's 12th man (a reference to the effect of the noise made by the crowd at the game).  It's actually very impressive.  Seattle has the loudest stadium in the NFL, as evidenced by the number of false start penalties of visiting teams.  Seattle leads the league with 52 - the next on the list has 38 penalties.  The crowd really matters and the "12" has become a seattle icon.
I'm now starting to count myself among the high-fiving Seahawks fans and I'm not ashamed to say it.  Go Seahawks!</div>

Posted from Lee's Mobile Phone. 
We had dinner tonight with our friends and former neighbors, the Ianniciellos.  Whenever I see the dog Zero, pictured above, I remember when he was a puppy.  He must has been 10 weeks old and Anthony brought him over after I said the now-famous line "Amos loves puppies."   And he did up to that point.  Before Zero even hit the floor, Amos bit at Zero with a loud and ferocious bark causing puppy Zero to whine in a panic for about 10 minutes.  No harm was done, but I was so embarrassed. It looked like I set the whole thing up.  All was forgiven until, a couple of years later, Amos finally had enough and bit Zero during a Superbowl party, causing Anthony to miss most of the game (and a sushi feast) to take Zero for stitches.  We've never figured it out, but we know Amos hates Zero like no other dog in the world.  From puppy to grown dog, it doesn't matter.  He has it in for that dog I swear.  Thankfully Anthony forgave me on both counts.</div>

A friendly wager of one dollar was put on the UNC game against Penn tonight betweem Blake and Mark.  Blake told us that when UNC scores over 100 points, Bojangles (chicken and biscuits fast food) gives free biscuits to all ticket holders.  Apparently, when the score approaches 100, the students start to chant "biscuits....biscuits"  The final score tonight was Penn 64 UNC 102.</div>

<div class="feed-item-body">I have a friend named Erik Benson who changed his name (legally) to <a href="http://www.43things.com/entries/view/1182607">Buster Butterfield McLeod </a>and started a new bar in Seattle with Lele McLeod (also legally changed) called the <a href="http://mcleodresidence.com/">McLeod Residence</a>.
