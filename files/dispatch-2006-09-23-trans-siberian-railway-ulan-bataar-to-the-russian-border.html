Sachi, the lucky, found that a couple of layers of skin had been worn away.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is not a good way to start a two day train ride.<o:p></o:p></span>  </p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black"></span>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">From the moment we stepped on the train, we were focused on the upcoming border ordeal with </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">Russia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">, famous for its 11 hour wait.<span>&nbsp; </span>The waiting around was not so bad except that the bathrooms on the train are locked for a majority of the time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course, this is because the toilet dumps directly onto the tracks below, potentially making the already sketchy border area a sewer as well.<span>&nbsp; </span>Our goal was bladder management, but just in case, we are holding a couple of plastic bottles in reserve.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">We knew we were supposed to arrive at the border at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="4"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">4AM</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black"> so we both got up at </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="3"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">3:30AM</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black"> to do what we could in the last minutes of the unlocked toilet.<span>&nbsp; </span>The train arrived, the toilets were locked and we were left alone for 4 hours until </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="8"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">8AM</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">, when the wait began for the border guards to arrive and take our passports for processing.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">For the entire train journey to this point, we operated only in the moment - by necessity.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was no train itinerary and the attendants only communicated in very basic terms.<span>&nbsp; </span>So we sat and waited and looked for our fellow passengers to appear on the platform - a sure sign that we can leave the train for a brief moment.<span>&nbsp; </span>Other than that we just asked &quot;Can we get off?&quot; and then try to figure out if the answer was a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &quot;no&rdquo;. Our fellow Western travelers were in a similar predicament.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">The border crossing into </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">Russia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black"> was done with little fanfare.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, someone presented himself soon after the border that was a bit startling for us.<span>&nbsp; </span>For the first time in 8 months, a government representative had blonde hair and blue eyes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Over a few minutes it was clear that the border with </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">Mongolia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black"> seems to represent the most genetically distinct border we&#39;ve crossed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Within about two kilometers the people became, very, very Russian.<span>&nbsp; </span>From what we&#39;d seen thus far, the Russians are quite beautiful people with bright eyes, distinct features and slim physiques.<span>&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">Just before stopping at customs an Asian women entered our berth and hung a jacket on a hook and walked away as if we would be happy to carry the jacket with us through customs.
