    <div class="info">By: leelefever on October 6, 2006 - 7:47am</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>Put simply, Norway&#39;s Lofoten Islands are surely the most stunning mountain scenery we&#39;ve ever experienced. I&#39;ll let the pictures and a few anecdotes tell the story...<img src="/files/includes/images/106-262276424_07090944fb.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="170" width="500" /></p><p>We stayed in a tiny fishing village called Henningsvaer,or <font size="-1">Henningsv&aelig;r, if you want to be accurate.&nbsp; Our <a href="http://www.henningsvar-rorbuer.no/engelsk/home.htm">lodging</a> for three nights was a &quot;rorbu&quot;, which is a fisherman&#39;s cabin redone for visitors.&nbsp; It was low season, so we got it for half price for three nights (USD$80 per night). It had a kitchen, a view over the water, four beds and low doorways - as my head would tell you.&nbsp; Our expectations were exceeded from the start.</font></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/79-262096742_10ef5ec16d.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Having a kitchen was nice because Norway is obscenely expensive: $8 dollars to rent a DVD, $10 for a pint of beer at a restaurant.&nbsp; We ate meatballs and noodles at &quot;home&quot;.&nbsp; Speaking of home, this was the view out of the back.<br /><img src="/files/includes/images/111-262276370_12c7b6b4de.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="200" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;and from the side...</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/99-262096892_33dcd46b58.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;The little town of <font size="-1">Henningsv&aelig;r, is called &quot;the Venice of the Lofotens&quot;. I think every country has a &quot;Venice of&quot; and &quot;Paris of&quot;.&nbsp; It is an incredibly charming place.</font><br /><img src="/files/includes/images/81-262276267_2ea45fa026.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="147" width="500" /></p><p>Here&#39;s a closer look at the mountains in the back...<br /><img src="/files/includes/images/99-262276000_4509ae06c6.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="196" width="500" /></p><p>However, the real sights, the real drama and the reason we took two days to arrive were the mountains that seemed to go on and on and provide a perfect backdrop for quaint arctic dioramas.<br /><img src="/files/includes/images/106-262276057_c5b9bcfa01.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="134" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/108-262097132_0f76633f12.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/85-262097400_32de4ea3a1.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>The Lofotens only get about 280,000 tourists a year, likey thanks to being so far out of the way. When we were there, it was low season and the place was empty - closed for the season and preparing for weeks of darkness. We would both like to experience an arctic winter some day.&nbsp; We&#39;ve done an Asian summer - why not an arctic winter?<img src="/files/includes/images/115-262276132_7f2978cdb1.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="150" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/100-262276210_b9681c7dac.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="144" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Did you know?&nbsp; Fjords are fjords because they are by the sea and are formed by glaciers.&nbsp; That is why you find them in places like Norway and <a href="/47/doubtfulsound">New Zealand</a> - places where giant glaciers existed.<br /><img src="/files/includes/images/41-262098103_c7c5b60cf5.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Despite all the focus on sealife and catching cod - we saw little wildlife, but I made friends with a jellyfish that liked to pose for the camera in the unbelievably crystal clear water...<img src="/files/includes/images/94-262097805_11dd35012c.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="/files/includes/images/90-262097867_5dd265a874.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In the end though, it was the glaciar-carved mountains in the rural artic settings that really peeled our scalp back, as our friend Tom would say.<br /><img src="/files/includes/images/88-262097011_8e2cf31fdf.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /><br />&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/117-261464876_47b7f8da43.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/116-261465107_0683d0015a.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/120-262097483_e501719d6e.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><br class="clear" />

    <p class="MsoNormal">By all accounts, the Yangtze cruise was an amazing experience and one that exceeded our expectations.<span>&nbsp; </span>It also reminded us how much we value our independence as travelers. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">We&rsquo;ve often witnessed large groups of people being led around popular tourist sites by someone holding a colored flag and possibly a loudspeaker slung across their shoulder.<span>&nbsp; </span>These are usually groups that arrive by bus and travel together as part of a package tour. For the first time on the trip, we became part of one of these groups, and it sometimes made us want to scream.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/60-224977047_97b9730107.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> is the sort of place that is often best explored with a tour group, as sites are set up to manage groups and not the independent traveler.<span>&nbsp; </span>After all, we heard it was only 20 years ago that each tour group had a &ldquo;government spy&rdquo; that would submit a report to the central government about the sights seen and questions asked.<span>&nbsp; </span>I suppose we should feel lucky to have access at all. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">At least once each day, we would be led off the boat and onto a bus where a government-employed tour guide for the day would provide information about the sites and answer questions. Upon arriving at a destination, we would disembark the bus and follow the flag to a meeting spot, where more details would follow.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometimes, you could break away, other times you had to stay with the group, all being herded through the tourist area as if we might get lost or hurt ourselves without the flag being in sight at all times.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">After traveling independently for so long we came to resent the flag and all for which it stands.<span>&nbsp; </span>We mocked the flag and joked about how we wish we had a flag in all parts of our lives.<span>&nbsp; </span>We called ourselves The Fellowship of the Flag. The flag became the symbol for all the things that we eschew about <b>de</b>pendent travel. <span>&nbsp;</span>Once, upon being told where and when to meet the group Sachi looked at me and said &ldquo;There is something about being told when and where to be that makes me sick.&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>I know how she felt.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The flag does offer some security I suppose and the flag bearer is often a knowledgeable and friendly person.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, as we discovered at <st1:place><st1:placename>Yellow</st1:placename>  <st1:placetype>Mountain</st1:placetype></st1:place>, the flag bearer can ruin a day.<span>&nbsp; </span>I had been looking forward to <st1:place><st1:placename>Yellow</st1:placename>  <st1:placetype>Mountain</st1:placetype></st1:place> for many months as it is the place of classic Chinese mountain scenery, with steep misty and craggy cliffs.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/69-223694844_9dca7f205e.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/90-223695508_dfc8c65885.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">Unfortunately, our flag bearer was a control freak. <span>&nbsp;</span>All we wanted to do was be on our own and return at a specified time to catch the bus &ndash; but this guy would not let us.<span>&nbsp; </span>I asked him for information so we could leave the group and he would blatantly ignore me and only say &ldquo;it is a highlight, I&rsquo;ll take you there&rdquo;.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then as Sachi asked &ldquo;Can you show it to us on the map?&rdquo; He just stared at her defiantly in the face and puffed away on his cigarette.<span>&nbsp; </span>You could almost hear him saying to himself &ldquo;independence in NOT a virtue&rdquo;.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/58-223694363_7cca6a7c5f.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">We and a few other Western couples attempted a break-away while waiting for the geezers in the group to ascend the steps but he stopped us in our tracks saying that he needed to &ldquo;make an important announcement&quot; &ndash; more waiting.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the end, we spent about two-thirds of our time waiting around with the flag Nazi and one-third actually exploring the scenery.<span>&nbsp; </span>He made us feel as if we were 5 years old and he was the sage grandfather who held the sacred knowledge of the mountain.<span>&nbsp; </span>This grandfather never uttered a word of wisdom, except where to go to catch the next cablecar.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Somehow we have made it through over 12 countries just fine without a flag leading the way and if we have a choice, the next twelve will be flag-less as well. </p>    <br class="clear" />

  <p>As a child, I remember seeing pictures of a magical place where the earth seemed to have burst right out of it&#39;s shell and created giant rounded stone mounds, set amongst rice paddies, rivers and farms.

Much to my enjoyment, we found this place in <a href="http://www.chinahighlights.com/guilin/index.htm">Guilin, China</a>.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/89-216459984_45ad0437a6.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;The mounds are actually called karsts and are made of limstone.&nbsp; 200 million years ago this part of China was under the sea and limestone was thrust upward from the earth&#39;s crust and then eroded into the shapes we see today.&nbsp;</p><p>The karsts are best viewed from a boat on the Li River and as most things in China, it is done as part of a package tour, complete with flag waving guide.&nbsp; Our guide was the delightfully geeky &quot;Jack&quot;.

  <p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m genetically inclined to remember all the names of these Japanese towns.&nbsp; They all have four syllables and seems to all begin or end in yama (which makes sense as &quot;yama&quot; means mountains and we&#39;re in the Japanese Alps).&nbsp; No matter though, what I will remember is the beauty of these places.</p><p>Unfortunately, Mother Nature has not been kind of late. In the past week we&#39;ve seen the sun on one day.&nbsp; Other than that, it has been rather dreary with occasional rain. On the other hand, it has been abour 65(f) degrees- which is simply luxurious compared to SE Asia.</p><p>&nbsp;We talked about some of these places, but didn&#39;t get to provide many pictures, so here is a load of pictures from the last week or so...Oh, and a big thanks to TwinF member (and long-time friend) Kai for <a href="/47/blog/kaibrown/old-japan">pointing us in the right direction</a>. </p><p>My favorite small town so far has been Tsuwano, where we stayed in the <a href="/47/ryokan">ryokan</a>. Here&#39;s the town from above:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/48-145033754_d5e3e210cd.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;The view above is from a hike we did up the Tsuwano Castle ruins- from about 1500AD.&nbsp; </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/51-145033772_853d4d35ff.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="111" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Here&#39;s Sachi on the ruins:</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/53-145033670_620737cfaf.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="500" width="375" /></p><p>&nbsp;I got to ride in this little bike thing called an Anttcycle.&nbsp; It&#39;s pedal powered with a little extra juice from solar power.&nbsp; Very cool, but I need an XL.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/52-145033582_10e853a847.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Tsuwano has a ton of these types of scenes too.&nbsp; I keep trying to find a picture that captures, to me at least, the essence of traditional Japanese style.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-145033388_3916aeb197.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;We&#39;re on trains a lot and it&#39;s fun and quite entertaining.&nbsp; Not once has a train been more than one minute late.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/50-145033227_438aba9df9.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Some of the trains have been around a while.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-148641549_e666adb606.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Sachi&#39;s not sad, just tired.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-146115053_ac2485d462.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Kanazawa was next.&nbsp; We really liked Kanazawa- it was very kind to tourists with good maps everywhere and a great overall experience- you can tell they are trying to become a tourist destination. The city has the most amazing train station exterior I&#39;ve seen. OK, maybe there were two days of sun. </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-146794722_52d90457b4.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Kanazawa&#39;s main attraction is Kenrokuen Gardens.&nbsp; It may have been that we don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; Japanese gardens. This one is nice and it may have been a bad time of year, but we were a little let down. The Kenrokuen Garden is rated as a top-3 garden in Japan.&nbsp; Still nice, but not what we expected.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/46-148654187_b7cf3a292c.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="138" width="500" /></p><p><i>&nbsp;Updated:</i>&nbsp; I wanted to say a little more about the Japanese gardens. I&#39;d say that we do &quot;get&quot; most gardens, but the Kenrokuen was different than we expected.&nbsp; It is known as the &quot;Garden of Six Attributes&quot;, which are: seclusion, antiquity, spaciousness, human ingenuity, water and scenic views.&nbsp; The one attribute that seems to get in the way for us is human ingenuity.&nbsp; All over Kenrokuen, trees are being propped up by braces- so much so that you can&#39;t appreciate the trees for the braces in the way:</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/51-148985683_084e0b98f4.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="500" width="375" /></p><p>The bracing is an ancient practice and is particularly useful in Kanazawa where it snows heavily.&nbsp; However, from my western and amateur perspective, the bracing is obtrusive and takes away too much of the natural beauty of the scenery and trees. But that&#39;s just me. </p><br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/darjeelingroadblock" title="Waiting It Out at the Darjeeling Roadblock">Waiting It Out at the Darjeeling Roadblock</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: sachilefever on March 29, 2006 - 9:37pm</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>I am feeling better! Finally. It&#39;s been too many days - though not unexpected here. On our way up to this mountaintop town of Darjeeling, I had some time to recover a little from the rattling jeep ride (Lee mentioned the strike). The word was out that at 6:00 the road would be opened, so we waited it out below the road block on the side of the road with hundreds of others. </p><p>I&#39;m getting used to all the stares and Indian men trying to bump into me all the time (bumpers up - I say). But yesterday one man who looked intent and unfriendly walked by our sitting Jeep a few times after Lee had gotten out to stretch his legs. The man stared the entire time. I had sunglasses on and ignored him. He walked to the front of the jeep obviously looking for the driver, then into a storefront door to find him, all the while making sure I was still there. Then he began talking to the timid teenager in the front seat that spoke almost no English. He was obviously asking about me - the kid kept saying I don&#39;t know - I don&#39;t know. I made sure my door was locked and then Lee leaned in on his door. &quot;He&#39;s asking about me.&quot; I said. Lee looked over at him across the Jeep and scowled and shook his head saying NO. The man shook his head back and walked away from the vehicle. Yay Lee! I was in no shape to deal with that situation. If the driver had been around, I&#39;m sure he would have told me to get out of the jeep and at least take a picture with the guy - and he would have tried to receive a pretty rupee from it. Not that I would do it. </p><p>I was never in any danger or felt unsafe at any time. It was just the ridiculousness of the situation and my low tolerance of it feeling so ill. We laughed about it for a while afterwards. When you feel healthy you have so much more confidence to be assertive and handle any situation that may arise. I think I might just climb a small mountain today!</p><br class="clear" />
