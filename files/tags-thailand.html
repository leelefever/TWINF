      <h2><a href="/tech_report_thailand" title="Tech Report: Thailand Mobile Networks">Tech Report: Thailand Mobile Networks</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on August 11, 2006 - 11:31pm</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p><i>Part of our trip is focused on experimenting with technology and mobile networks as we travel around the world.&nbsp; A <a href="/47/tags/techreport">tech report</a> is our way of relating the geeky side of what we&#39;re discovering.&nbsp;</i></p><p>In an SMS with our friend <a href="http://www.newley.com/">Newley Purnell</a> in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region>, I wrote that southern <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region> is paradise, complete with great Internet access.<span>&nbsp; </span>In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region>, it seems that high-speed Internet cafes are never farther than the next corner. In a number of ways, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region> is a tech wonderland.  </p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Our Treo 650 GSM phone integrated perfectly with the Thai network.<span>&nbsp; </span>I asked our first taxi driver about the best mobile network and he said &ldquo;AIS&rdquo; and after spending nearly 2 months in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region> I know he was right.<span>&nbsp; </span>I bought a new SIM card ($10) with a network called &ldquo;1-2-Call&rdquo; and was immediately able to connect to the GPRS network (Internet access and email) and make calls.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thanks to promotions, I often had many credits to use the GPRS network for free.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was able to easily take pictures, send them in email to Flickr and have Flickr post the picture and entry here on TwinF immediately.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mobile blogging was easy in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region> and comparably cheap too.<span>&nbsp; </span>I spent about $70 on all our mobile phones-based activities, which included daily web browsing, often for extended periods.<span>&nbsp; </span>An unlimited data and phone plan in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region> costs about $80 per month.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Mobile coverage in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region> was ubiquitous &ndash; I don&rsquo;t remember a time when we were left wanting for network service.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was easy for us to view this kind of coverage from a tourist perspective, but the fact is that, especially in rural areas, mobile phone access is a lifeline for the Thai people.<span>&nbsp; </span>The people who are conducting business (with or without tourism) can gain significant efficiency with a mobile network.&nbsp; Look for these signs:</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/83-213020336_235d048b70.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><st1:city><st1:place>Bangkok</st1:place></st1:city> and specifically the Siam Square (MBK) area of <st1:city><st1:place>Bangkok</st1:place></st1:city> offers some of the best technology shopping in <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Bargaining is the norm and it&rsquo;s advisable to pit sellers against one another to get the best price.<span>&nbsp; </span>I bought a 2mb SD card for about US$75 and I priced the same card at $160 previously.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Before we left for the trip, I questioned the need to have a laptop computer.<span>&nbsp; </span>In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region>, more than any place else, the laptop came in very handy as an entertainment tool.<span>&nbsp; </span>This, of course, is because of the incredible amount of movie and music piracy that occurs in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Reprehensible or not, we were constantly flush with the latest flicks.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Also, I discovered a new and better way to upload pictures, blog, etc. from Internet cafes.<span>&nbsp; </span>I used to put everything on a USB pen drive and take it to an Internet caf&eacute;. Now I take the whole computer with me and ask them to let me plug it into their Ethernet cable.<span>&nbsp; </span>So far this has worked every time and I can work from the comfort and relative cleanliness of my own computer. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">If you&rsquo;re traveling in Thailand for more than a week or two and need to use your phone a lot, I recommend buying a new SIM card (on the AIS, 1-2-Call Network) for your mobile needs.</p>  <br class="clear" />

    <div class="content">

    <p>Last week in Chiang Mai, we took a couple of days of cooking classes and met a couple from the Bay Area named <a href="http://bigkatamari.blogspot.com/">Nadav and Anya</a>.&nbsp; Through some chit-chat we discovered that they have been on a journey similar to ours, including a few days on the Thai island of Phi Phi.</p>  <p>After the class was over, we got an email from Nadav and this is what it said:</p>  <p><span class="blockquote">So nice to meet you today...As it turns out, we&#39;ve been reading your blog for about a week already. We were looking for information on Phi Phi, did a google blogsearch and found you! Thanks to your post, we decided to go. Thanks for the recommendation! Best wishes, and happy trails</span> How cool! I&#39;m excited that we were able to point these guys to <a href="/ko_phi_phi">something we enjoyed</a>, but also I think it is great that we can use this little site to encourage people to visit a beautiful place that really needs more help (in the form of tourist dollars) recovering from the tsunami. </p>  <br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/riding_elephants" title="Should We Be Riding Elephants in Thailand?">Should We Be Riding Elephants in Thailand?</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on June 22, 2006 - 3:48am</div>

    <div class="content">

    <p class="MsoNormal">Among travelers to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region> (myself included) and readers of posts like this, a few questions come to mind. They include: </p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Should we be riding around on elephants?<span>&nbsp; </span>Isn&rsquo;t the elephant being exploited? Is it inhumane for elephants to be used for tourism?</i></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Of course we all wish the elephants could live in the wild and be undisturbed by humans.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, for about the <a href="http://www.thailandelephant.org/eng/article.php3?no=12">last 4500 years</a>, elephants have been captured, domesticated and used for transportation, labor and even warfare.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For thousands of years, the elephant has been living with and around humans and over that time we humans have learned the requirements for ensuring that the relationship is stable and productive.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of the outgrowths of these years of domestication is the <a href="http://www.thaipro.com/detailed/99999/Thailand_elephant_Thai_mahout.htm">role of mahout</a>, which is the elephant&rsquo;s trainer- an essential and vital role for the elephant and human.<span>&nbsp; </span>For the last three days, I learned a little about being a mahout and his relationship with the elephant. These are mahouts with their elephants at the <a href="http://www.changthai.com/">Thai&nbsp; Elephant Conservation Center</a>:</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/46-172559006_7259f1cc6e.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The mahout has a unique relationship with the elephant- one that can last decades.<span>&nbsp; </span>When an elephant is born into domestication, it is assigned a mahout who will be responsible for the elephant for the mahout&rsquo;s whole life.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, some elephants outlive their mahouts (elephants can live 80+ years) and the elephant is then often passed down to the mahout&rsquo;s son. As you might imagine, a strong bond develops between the mahout and the elephant that goes beyond trainer and animal.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I asked about the nature of the relationship, it was described as companionship.<span>&nbsp; </span>The elephant seeks the company of the mahout and feels at home with the mahout on his back- they are a lifelong team.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">As I <a href="/47/mahout">experienced</a>, the relationship is not one purely of hugs and treats.<span>&nbsp; </span>As dog owners know, a dog seeks to be the alpha (dominant) dog in the family and if it perceives that it has reached this role, it will become less trainable and try to dominate the humans. The same basic idea is true with the elephants.<span>&nbsp; </span>The mahout must maintain a relationship with the elephant that ensures that the elephant is not dominant, but submissive to the mahout.<span>&nbsp; </span>A dominant elephant can be lethal. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">How do you dominate an elephant?<span> </span>Unfortunately, is partially through pain, or at least the threat of pain.<span>&nbsp; </span>Elephants are incredible heavy, strong, willful and tough animals. In order for the mahout to be able to train the elephant, he must have some way to send positive and negative messages.<span>&nbsp; </span>Along with voice commands and touching, the tool of choice for mahouts is an ominous looking pointed metal hook called an ankus. This hook is used to guide the elephant and to correct poor behavior.<span>&nbsp; </span>Though it seems a bit barbaric to the layperson, this evolved over many years and ensures that the elephant and mahout have mutual respect.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/67-172560777_7881c48137.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /><o:p> <br /></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">For hundreds of years in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region>, elephants were domesticated for working in the logging industry.<span>&nbsp; </span>Their mahouts <a href="http://www.chiangmai-thai.com/elephant.htm">trained them to do</a> the heavy lifting required in moving logs.<span>&nbsp; </span>While not necessarily a happy existence for the animals, it ensured that the mahout could have money to feed and care for the elephant. In 1989 the Thai government banned commercial logging in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region>. This event left many mahouts and elephants unemployed and forced some onto the streets of <st1:city><st1:place>Bangkok</st1:place></st1:city>. Keeping an unemployed elephant fed and cared-for is no easy task and often means disaster for the mahout and his family. Suddenly, the elephants became more of a liability than a source of income and many elephants were abandoned or killed in a sad turn of events.<span>&nbsp; Today there are <a href="http://www.phuket.com/conservation/elephants.htm">between 3-5000 elephants in Thailand</a> (domestic and wild) and their numbers are falling about 3% a year.&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Today, many elephants have found a new home by working in the eco-tourism industry.<span>&nbsp; </span>Elephants that are sufficiently trained and mild-mannered can now be supported through tourism.<span>&nbsp; </span>By offering rides through the jungle, elephant shows and elephant education, the mahouts and their elephants can support themselves without the logging industry.<span>&nbsp; </span>For many elephants, working conditions are greatly improved and as more tourists come to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region> more elephants can be supported.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The <a href="http://www.changthai.com/"><st1:place><st1:placename>Thai</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Elephant</st1:placename>  <st1:placename>Conservation</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place></a> was created by the government to educate the public about elephants and works to ensure their survival in the future.<span>&nbsp; </span>Part of the center&rsquo;s mission is to promote the elephant as an element of eco-tourism- an element that is healthy, sustainable and promotes increased understanding of the animals.<span>&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, a lot of work needs to be done.<span>&nbsp; </span>Elephant numbers are declining and there are many sick and starving elephants in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region> with no means of support.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>So, to return to the original questions&hellip;</b></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><i>Should we be riding around on these animals?<span>&nbsp; </span>Isn&rsquo;t the elephant being exploited? Is it inhumane for elephants to be used for tourism?</i></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Of course, this is a personal decision.<span>&nbsp; </span>I realize that many readers will not ride an elephant on principle alone.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, I hope that I&rsquo;ve provided information here that illustrates a bit of the complex circumstances of the elephants in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It is my perspective that by becoming educated about domestic elephants and choosing to patronize respectable eco-tourism operators in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region>, you can have a positive impact on the precarious situation of these beautiful animals.

  <p>Though they say that the classes are sold out until August, I somehow got myself into a three-day &quot;homestay&quot; elephant mahout training course, starting tomorrow.&nbsp; It&#39;s through the much-respected <a href="http://www.changthai.com/">Thai Elephant Conservation Center</a>, which offers 1 day, 3 day and 10-30 day courses where you learn to care for, bathe, ride and train a single elephant.&nbsp; This should be really, really interesting.&nbsp; I do love those beasts.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; Sachi isn&#39;t going to join me, so she is going to party solo in Chaing Mai for a few days- our first (even hours) apart in six months.</p><p>More info on the course <a href="http://changthai.com/elephant/viewtopic.php?t=138">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />

  <p>I can&#39;t say I had ever talked to a monk.&nbsp; We see them a lot in Thailand, with their orange robes, shaved heads and quant smiles.&nbsp; I have been curious about monks and buddhism for a while and this was my chance to learn about their daily life.&nbsp; </p><p>The MCU Buddhist University in Chiang Mai has a program called <a href="http://www.monkchat.net/">Monk Chat</a>, where laypeople such as myself can go and talk to monks for a bit in a relaxed environment. The monks are all students at the University, which has the longest name evar: <font color="#008080"><font size="2">Mahachulalongkornrajvidalaya Buddhist University.</font></font></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/77-169532017_131220baf2.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>I had the pleasure of meeting Souk (above), who is from Loas and in his 4th year at the university.&nbsp; His English as very good (the program is, in part, meant to help their English) and he was no different that the nice guy you&#39;d meet in the street.&nbsp; In fact, he takes great pride in presenting himself with humor and laughter as it enables people (like me) to feel more comfortable in his presence.&nbsp; I talked for about an hour with Souk and his friends and got a feel for their student life, which involves a lot of early mornings and meditation.&nbsp; He knows more about the World Cup than me and seems to be more of a typical college student than I would have thought.&nbsp; He imparted some of his philosophy in saying that as a monk, there a number of rules, but the most important thing is to do good and serve as a positive example. I consider Souk a friend and I hope he is reading this. Hi Souk!<br /></p><p>Monk Chat occurs every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 5-7 pm. The University is beside Wat Suan Dok, which is nice for a visit as well. I recommend it wholeheartedly. </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/45-169532134_20e870a4f4.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="148" width="500" /></p><br class="clear" />

The Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej is celebrating 60 years on the throne (making him the world&#39;s longest serving monarch) and this event has the Thai people entranced.  A couple of nights ago, the King welcomed royalty from over 25 countries to his palace for a gala and it seemed that every Thai TV in the country tuned in for the event.  As we learned the next day, it was extremely rare for the people to see their beloved King, even on TV. As one restaurant manager explained to us &quot;everyone is just so happy for the King&quot;.  The event even took precedence over the World Cup. <a href="/47/news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/5062534.stm">More on BBC News</a><br /><br /> The reason I say it is incomprehensible to us is that we have never known an enduring personal symbol of our country.  Seeing the incredible love, dedication and almost religious devotion to the King, it makes us realize how important his role is for national unity and stability.  He is, to an astounding degree, the symbol of Thai success, morality and stability.  It makes us wonder what it would be like to have American royalty.  Would the country be so divided?  Would the American equivalent of the Thai King be a positive influence, or a joke? </p><br class="clear" />

Lee regrets not brushing teeth after pre-bed Oreo snack.  Shower and finish packing.<br /><br /> 6:35am - Walk to free (or included) breakfast.  Yoghurt, pineapple,  meusli, toast for Lee; rice and pineapple for Sachi.<br /><br /> 6:50am - Pay final bill at checkout.  An extra night plus 2 lunches and a couple of minibar indiscretions = about US$100.  Karon Beach Resort was a bit of a splurge.<br /><br /> 6:55am - Go outside assuming we would see taxis or car-like tuk-tuks.  None are found, feel at-risk for missing flight.  Go back to hotel reception, she calls their driver- he cannot come for 20 mins- not enough time (he says) to make our flight.  Bell boy takes off on motorcycle to track down taxi (earns nice tip).<br /><br />  7:03am - Aging Alpha Romeo taxi appears.  We climb in and find that we could have saved money by using the hotel minivan.  Feel regret for not accepting the hotel&#39;s offer yesterday.<br /><br />  7:52am - Arrive at airport, check in, buy Rough Guide to SE Asia.<br /><br /> 8:25am - Board bus to plane and wait for 20 minutes on stationary bus.  Travel approximately 150 meters to plane.  Laugh with other passengers about the ridiculously short bus trip.<br /><br /> 8:50am - Board plane to Bangkok.<br /><br /> 10:28am - Arrive Bagkok, recheck in for Air Asia flight to Chiang Mai.  Find infinite amusement is witnessing a women scurry rapidly from her family to ensure a place in line in front of us- for a flight leaving in 2 hours.<br /><br /> 11:22am - while waiting for flight, try to connect to airport wireless internet. Costs US$7 per hour.  No way - too much.  Domestic terminal lunch options are:  Burger King, Smoking Pub, Black Canyon Coffee and Dairy Queen. We have Whoppers.<br /><br /> 1:05pm - Discover that flight is delayed 1 hour.  Meet Sonja, who just graduated high school and has lived in Chang Mai for 5 years.<br /><br /> 2:10pm - Board flight to Chang Mai on low-cost Air Asia (US$38PP).  Feel pressure to compete for unassigned seats. Share our row with Sonja, who is 1/2 Iranian and 1/2 white American and has lived in Atlanta, Swaziland, Cambodia and Thailand.  Really cool to talk to Sonja. She recommends the Amora Hotel and even has a business card.<br /><br /> 3:55pm Arrive at aging but nice Amora hotel, reserve 5 nights for about US$40 per night, breakfast included.. Great location. Relax and plan.<br /><br /> 5:05pm - Walk blindly into Chiang Mai streets, quickly discover a neighborhood full of uninteresting house fixtures.  Find better street, eat at Noi&#39;s Kitchen, buy book on Pol Pot.  Return to hotel.<br /><br /> 6:09pm - Lee is awed to see this text scroll across the TV screen on BBC World News:  &quot;Microsoft blogger who made the software giant more human is leaving to join a technology startup&quot;.  Scoble made the BBC World ticker? Wow.<br /><br /> 7:12pm - Sachi dissects our toiletries bag and finds 31 miniature toothpaste bottles from Japanese hotels (pictured above).  We realize a great travel tip: If you have more than one of something, use it up completely before opening the next. Otherwise you carry mutiples forever (like both of Lee&#39;s half-full mini shaving cream bottles).<br /><br /> 8:05pm - Head out to the THC Rooftop Bar, cool hippy atomsphere and uncool unhippy staff- no smiles at all.  Have dinner for 3 dollars (panang curry beef, oyster sauce beef and pineapple shake).<br /><br /> 9:55pm - Return to hotel to settle in watching US play Czechs in world cup, feeling good about Chaing Mai.<br /><br /> 11:59pm - Feel disappointment for USA&#39;s poor showing.  Sad to see so much ball possession, so little goal scoring. </p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="content">

  <p>If someone were to visit the Thai island of Ko Phi Phi with no knowledge of the tsunami in 2004, they might not ever notice that it was the scene of real devastation. The natural beauty, the wonderful people and the island atomosphere are well intact. Though the final toll may never be known, 75% of the buildings were destroyed and about 2000 people were killed in the tsunami, including about 1200 that are listed as missing. Wikipedia has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_Phi_Islands">more info</a>.<br /></p><p>Ko Phi Phi has a rather vulnerable geographic position that caused both sides of the most populated area to be hit by the wave.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.inet.co.th/tsunami/images/PP_45B_2_320.mov">This video</a> simulation shows how the wave hit.&nbsp; The biggest concentration of people was in the tiny isthmus (150 meters wide) between the two islands at the&nbsp; top.&nbsp;</p><p>Just as you get off the pier at Ton Sai beach, you notice some fields to the left with no buildings.&nbsp; Before the tsunami, these fields had high end bungalows, all of which were destroyed and/or swept away. This photo is looking aross the isthmus looking between Ton Sai Beach towards Loh Dalam Bay where resorts and bungalows used to be.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/62-163439402_12862a8ea9.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;As you might imagine, there are signs and warning systems everywhere now.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/48-163438814_e75f50ca47.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Apparently the relief effort was centered at Carlito&#39;s Bar, which is down the beach a few hundred meters and spared.&nbsp; We heard a story that Carlito himself perished while trying to save others. We met an American that owns a group of used book stores (D&#39;s Books) and he showed us the level where the water came into his store (though he didn&#39;t own it then).&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/64-163438060_1c0a85bdcd.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /></p><p>Despite some controversy, reconstruction is well underway.&nbsp; We found the island to be clean and mostly debris free. &nbsp;</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/73-163438527_10767ebf86.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>There are sure signs of quick recovery, though, as visitors, we can only know so much. Last night we walked by the small school grounds and there was some sort of festival going on.&nbsp; About 75 kids were all dancing in the courtyard under lights and corporate sponsored tents, surely donated for relief.&nbsp; The kids were having such fun, dancing and horsing around- smiles everywhere.&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t help but wonder what mark the tsunami might have left on these kids and how they are coping.&nbsp; Like everyone that lives here, I&#39;m sure the scars will take a while to heal, but for last night and for our whole time here, people seem to be more focused on the future than the past. Seeing those kids so happy gave me a good feeling that recovery, in a number of forms, is well underway.</p><p>If you&#39;re thinking of going to Phi Phi, we highly recommend it.&nbsp; Your tourist dollars do a lot for the local economy and it is an incredibly beautiful place.&nbsp; This is a panorama of Loh Dalam Bay:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/76-163439513_414b5c8c55.jpg-v-0.jpg" class="reflect" height="145" width="500" /></p><br class="clear" />
