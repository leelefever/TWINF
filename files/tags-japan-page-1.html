  <p>The Japanese seem to have a special way of expressing themselves when it comes to signs or placards.&nbsp; While most are normal signs, some are beautiful in their own way, some are hilarious and some are just weird.&nbsp; Here are a few we&#39;ve seen:</p><p>We saw this on the way into a subway.&nbsp; Its design is something I&#39;d like to have on a t-shirt:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/48-153639767_631baf5cd7.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp; Everytime I see this crosswalk sign, I think that we&#39;re being warned to watch out for George Washington crossing the street with a devil child.</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/44-146114785_6f673fd474.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /></p><p>&nbsp;In Japan, you should be sure to STOP using rocket shoes!</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/67-153631212_d8a885c1bc.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Oh, and in Japan, you should never let Pac-man drink. waka waka waka waka.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/54-153631064_e450d6c4f1.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Of course, we&#39;ve seen this one in a previous post, but it deserves another look.&nbsp; Scrape it off your shoe, sprinkle it in your hand and smoke it?</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/51-145019869_0830b7ad29.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /></p><p>&nbsp;Apparently getting hit with a baseball in Japan is bad for your looks too.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/65-153631258_7d0cd64d8c.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>There&#39;s a lot of fodder around the thousands of bar names, but I thought this one was particularly pertinent.

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on May 24, 2006 - 5:38pm</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>We&#39;ve been collecting some pictures and thoughts regarding the ways in which Japan is different from our home in the US and other places we visit. This is the first installment of the &quot;In Japan&quot; or &quot;In (country name)&quot; series.</p><p>One of the unavoidable facts of travel is that travelers will experience the toilets in foreign lands.&nbsp; Compared to India, Sri Lanka and Thailand, Japanese toilets are a clean, porcelain dream. Though, there are difficulties to be had.</p><p>For instance, for the first time on the trip, I could not distinguish between the men&#39;s and women&#39;s toilets.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/55-152414399_7fd3f4c881_m.jpg" align="left" /> <img src="/files/includes/images/47-144325675_9e4a9b803a_m.jpg" /></p><p>&nbsp;Hat or bowtie?&nbsp; Which is more manly?&nbsp; Sachi wasn&#39;t there to help with the kanji either.&nbsp; The men&#39;s room is on the right.</p><p>In Japan, some of the toilet seats have nice cotton covers- which is an indication of the general trust in the responsible actions of men, or maybe I was in the girl&#39;s room and didn&#39;t know it.<br /></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/46-140015979_5d3d676ed9.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;In Japan, it&#39;s impossible talk about toilets without mentioning the buttons, or more precisely the number of services provided by the buttons.&nbsp; Your basic, everyday toilet has these buttons, with the possible exception of a control for the seat warmer and size-of-flush control. Little water heads actually come out and spray upwards- potentially creating a toilet fountain for those unintitiated. </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/51-149762985_b0af8d4e0f.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>In Japan, travelers sometimes come across the Batmobile of toilets, like this 17 button beauty:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/56-151189354_ce5207c035.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Among the various bidet style functions, this one has a dryer, controls for lowering and raising the seat and various buttons and a screen that must do very important things that are opaque to me.</p><p>I&#39;m conflicted, personally.&nbsp; I like some of the features and I do think some improvements could be made to our home toilet.&nbsp; But, I can&#39;t help but think that the toilet features, like the Shinkansen, are a bit gratuitous. In the high tech world I would say that the toilets in Japan suffer from &quot;feature creep&quot;- meaning that the designers were more focused on &quot;could&quot; than &quot;should&quot; - which usually creates a less user-friendly product.&nbsp; In Japan, many things seem to be over-engineered, but that&#39;s a different post. </p><br class="clear" />

I can't get enough of the bullet trains. It seems to me that the design of the front of the train is a bit gratuitous.  Does it really need to look that cool to function properly, or is it all just looks?  It doesn't matter to me.<br class="clear" />

  <p>Lee is 6&#39;3&quot; (190cm) tall and doesn&#39;t always seem to physically fit in Japan. Bus seats never have enough legroom. So many clothing shop clerks look at him and cross their arms in an &quot;X&quot; as if to say &quot;Our clothes are too small for you!&quot; Tonight the hotel attendant ran to find Lee larger house slippers because none would fit him. </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-145033620_f9fb193249.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>He even tries his best to take up as little space as he can on the trains to avoid being the big American with big arm movements - we&#39;ve noticed even the tiniest of school girls only open their small books half a page wide to read on the trains.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-145033201_e731217644.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>We visited a 350 year old temple/house in Kanazawa that was secretly built with 3 stories on the outside, but 7 &quot;layers&quot; on the inside. It is affectionately named &quot;Ninja-dera&quot; (Ninja Temple) because of the self-locking trap doors, see-through stairways and 27 hidden staircases.&nbsp;</p><p>Lee has been proud of not accidently punching an elbow through any fragile shoji doors, and being careful to watch low doorway beams over the last few weeks.&nbsp; However, that day he took a step back. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We were not allowed to take any photos, but the 350 year old beams provided many obstacles in small rooms as we followed the 8 person tour group through the floors. There was one room set under a stairway made of wooden slats and white paper so any intruders would easily be seen and subsequently find their legs slashed from under the stairs. The ceiling was maybe as high as his shoulder, but everyone else fit just fine standing in the room. He stood on the last step just outside of the ceiling beam peering into the room over everyone - a giant among the Japanese - grinning and waiting for end of the description in Japanese. Our calm and professional tour guide smiled along with the knowing chuckles of the Japanese in the group and kept her tour moving. </p><p>&nbsp;The next set of stairs leading to a room with 5 exits and secret stairways caught Lee by surprise. THUD! He whacked his forehead on the beam and grimaced &quot;I almost made it all the way through the house!&quot;. Our tour guide couldn&#39;t help but giggle.</p><p>It&#39;s obvious that Japan&#39;s chairs, ceilings, clothes, vehicles etc. were not made for Lee but he&#39;s enjoying it all anyway, if only from afar or at least just outside peering in... </p><br class="clear" />

  <p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m genetically inclined to remember all the names of these Japanese towns.&nbsp; They all have four syllables and seems to all begin or end in yama (which makes sense as &quot;yama&quot; means mountains and we&#39;re in the Japanese Alps).&nbsp; No matter though, what I will remember is the beauty of these places.</p><p>Unfortunately, Mother Nature has not been kind of late. In the past week we&#39;ve seen the sun on one day.&nbsp; Other than that, it has been rather dreary with occasional rain. On the other hand, it has been abour 65(f) degrees- which is simply luxurious compared to SE Asia.</p><p>&nbsp;We talked about some of these places, but didn&#39;t get to provide many pictures, so here is a load of pictures from the last week or so...Oh, and a big thanks to TwinF member (and long-time friend) Kai for <a href="/47/blog/kaibrown/old-japan">pointing us in the right direction</a>. </p><p>My favorite small town so far has been Tsuwano, where we stayed in the <a href="/47/ryokan">ryokan</a>. Here&#39;s the town from above:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/48-145033754_d5e3e210cd.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;The view above is from a hike we did up the Tsuwano Castle ruins- from about 1500AD.&nbsp; </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/51-145033772_853d4d35ff.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="111" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Here&#39;s Sachi on the ruins:</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/53-145033670_620737cfaf.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="500" width="375" /></p><p>&nbsp;I got to ride in this little bike thing called an Anttcycle.&nbsp; It&#39;s pedal powered with a little extra juice from solar power.&nbsp; Very cool, but I need an XL.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/52-145033582_10e853a847.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Tsuwano has a ton of these types of scenes too.&nbsp; I keep trying to find a picture that captures, to me at least, the essence of traditional Japanese style.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-145033388_3916aeb197.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;We&#39;re on trains a lot and it&#39;s fun and quite entertaining.&nbsp; Not once has a train been more than one minute late.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/50-145033227_438aba9df9.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Some of the trains have been around a while.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-148641549_e666adb606.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Sachi&#39;s not sad, just tired.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-146115053_ac2485d462.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Kanazawa was next.&nbsp; We really liked Kanazawa- it was very kind to tourists with good maps everywhere and a great overall experience- you can tell they are trying to become a tourist destination. The city has the most amazing train station exterior I&#39;ve seen. OK, maybe there were two days of sun. </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-146794722_52d90457b4.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Kanazawa&#39;s main attraction is Kenrokuen Gardens.&nbsp; It may have been that we don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; Japanese gardens. This one is nice and it may have been a bad time of year, but we were a little let down. The Kenrokuen Garden is rated as a top-3 garden in Japan.&nbsp; Still nice, but not what we expected.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/46-148654187_b7cf3a292c.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="138" width="500" /></p><p><i>&nbsp;Updated:</i>&nbsp; I wanted to say a little more about the Japanese gardens. I&#39;d say that we do &quot;get&quot; most gardens, but the Kenrokuen was different than we expected.&nbsp; It is known as the &quot;Garden of Six Attributes&quot;, which are: seclusion, antiquity, spaciousness, human ingenuity, water and scenic views.&nbsp; The one attribute that seems to get in the way for us is human ingenuity.&nbsp; All over Kenrokuen, trees are being propped up by braces- so much so that you can&#39;t appreciate the trees for the braces in the way:</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/51-148985683_084e0b98f4.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="500" width="375" /></p><p>The bracing is an ancient practice and is particularly useful in Kanazawa where it snows heavily.&nbsp; However, from my western and amateur perspective, the bracing is obtrusive and takes away too much of the natural beauty of the scenery and trees. But that&#39;s just me. </p><br class="clear" />
