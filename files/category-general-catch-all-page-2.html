  <p>Greetings mates,</p><p>Have you recently looked at your passport photo? I betcha 90% of you are not really fond of it.&nbsp; I wanted to share with you the great free <a href="http://www.epassportphoto.com/">online service to create passport photo</a>&nbsp;from <a href="http://www.epassportphoto.com/">http://www.epassportphoto.com/</a>.&nbsp; For us and our newly born babe it worked like a charm.&nbsp; All we needed to do was take a digital photo at home and then upload it to their service.&nbsp; What I liked the most that finally I could pick my favorite smile to have it on my passport for the next decade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Happy travelling!</p><p>Trish</p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="info">By: Charme on January 19, 2006 - 4:52am</div>

  <div class="picture"><img src="/files/includes/images/system-files-pictures-picture-230.jpg" alt="Charme&#039;s picture" title="Charme&#039;s picture"  /></div>  <div class="content">

  <p>...than Orchard Road.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you've travelled for thousands or hundreds of miles, the last thing you want to see for your efforts is 'Borders'. Yes, shopping in Singapore is brilliant, and it is good value for money...you can get practically anything under the (rather hot) sun there (have I mentioned that local attempts at fashion are simply gorgeous?!), but for the full cultural experience, might I suggest doing away with the whole 'package tour' deal. Since most Singaporeans speak English (charmingly referred to as 'Singlish') anyway, finding your way around will be no problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do a little research before you go...If possible, get to know a few locals who might be able to take you off-the-beaten-track. Otherwise, a few simple questions at your hotel or any MRT station would usually get you facing in the right direction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To start off, you can visit a wet market (the ground might be slippery, so wear an old pair of trainers with lots of grip), and the temples and shops in Chinatown&nbsp;or Little India. <a title="Sentosa" href="http://www.sentosa.com.sg/" target="_blank">Sentosa</a> is also a nice family resort if you have the time, and Haw Par Villa a themepark with a macabre difference. Singapore is&nbsp;not known as a food paradise for nothing...Authentic cuisines from all over the world&nbsp;are offered there, and at a very cheap price too!!! To cut costs, instead of room service at your hotel, sample the local fare at the outdoor Hawker Centres (email me if you want to know the best places to go, or the best foods to try). Most&nbsp;of them&nbsp;are open from early morning till late at night, some even 24/7. There are also Pasar Malams (night markets/bazaars) where you can haggle to your heart's content.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To learn the local history, take yourself down to the museums (or the waxworks at Sentosa if it's still there) or the <a title="Esplanade" href="http://www.esplanade.com/" target="_blank">Esplanade</a> near Marina Bay, where you can enjoy the artistic endeavours of Southeast Asia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As for the local transport, get yourself an <a title="EZLink Card" href="http://www.ezlink.com.sg/" target="_blank">EZLink Card</a>, which works almost the same way as the Oyster card in London (you can even donate it to a good cause when you leave). Last time I was there, they did a very good deal for tourists, which would also earn you discounts at a few shops and restaurants. The&nbsp;EZLink Card&nbsp;can be used on the MRT and buses...But of course, you could always hire a trishaw!!! <img alt="Tongue out" src="/files/includes/images/47-hm-profiles-standard-modules-tinymce-tinymce-jscripts-tiny_mce-plugins-emotions-images-smiley-tongue-out.gif" border="0" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If it is at all possible, arrange to go during the festive period (such as Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, Chingay, Deepavali or Thaipusam etc...even Christmas is an eye-opener there). Singapore might be tiny, but because of its mixed ethnic cultures, there is a lot to see. The nightlife is also particularly interesting. Boat Quay and Clarke Quay are a stretch of lively bars, restaurants, shops and clubs along the Singapore River. You can get a boat ride from one end to the other, and possibly view the Merlion statue whilst you're at it. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Other&nbsp;venues&nbsp;where you can mingle with the natives and&nbsp;overdose on Singapore sights and sounds are <a title="Fort Canning Park" href="http://www.nparks.gov.sg/nparks_cms/display_park.asp?parkid=7" target="_blank">Fort Canning Park</a> (where you can have a BBQ after a ramble), <a title="Mount Faber" href="http://www.mountfaber.com.sg/" target="_blank">Mount Faber</a> (there's an alfresco bar - Altivo - at the top of the hill), <a title="Chijmes" href="http://www.chijmes.com.sg/" target="_blank">Chijmes</a> (which was a convent school dating back to the old colonial days, now converted to something a little more&nbsp;trendy, and quite possibly sinful), Bugis Street (used to be a the unofficial 'gay district' where some of the old shophouses may still stand in their newly 'preserved' state, although Katong or Geylang&nbsp;might be better places for&nbsp;historical architecture&nbsp;if you don't mind the 'girly bars')&nbsp;etc etc...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are loads more places which I have probably forgot to mention, but it's nothing a little 'Googling' around won't remedy...Here are a few sites to get you going:</p><ul><li><a title="Visit Singapore" href="http://www.visitsingapore.com/" target="_blank">Uniquely&nbsp;Singapore</a>&nbsp;(Official Guidebook)</li><li><a title="CIA World Factbook on Singapore" href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/sn.html" target="_blank">CIA World Factbook on Singapore</a></li><li><a title="BBC Country Profile on Singapore" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/country_profiles/1143240.stm" target="_blank">BBC Country Profile on Singapore</a></li><li><a title="Singapore in Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore" target="_blank">Singapore in Wikipedia</a></li><li><a title="Lonely Planet Guide to Singapore" href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/destinations/asia/singapore/" target="_blank">Lonely Planet Guide to Singapore</a></li><li><a title="Move and Stay Guide" href="http://www.moveandstay.com/singapore" target="_blank">Move and Stay Guide</a></li><li><a title="Transitlink" href="http://www.transitlink.com.sg/" target="_blank">Transitlink</a></li><li><a title="Singapore eCitizen" href="http://tt.ecitizen.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Singapore eCitizen</a></li><li><a title="Street Directory" href="http://www.streetdirectory.com/" target="_blank">Singapore Street Directory &amp; Transport Guide</a></li></ul><p><img title="River Hong Bao" style="width: 230px; height: 160px" height="160" alt="River Hong Bao" src="/files/includes/images/24-88550397_c893c3d946_o.jpg" width="230" border="1" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>PS - The law doesn't actually ban the chewing of gum, but importing or&nbsp;selling it&nbsp;has been prohibited...No, I don't get it either. Still, it's one of the cleanest cities in the world, so they must be doing something right!</p><br class="clear" />

  <p>hi guys!&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>found you from lee's site.&nbsp; i'm in melbourne so if you are headed this way, let me know and i can give you some ideas of stuff to do and meet up for a drink. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>seems you're flying into brisbane so here's my 2 brissy tips... go to NY Slice at 360 brunswick street in fortitude valley if you're craving nyc pizza (as i do).&nbsp; that area is also big for night life and shops. &nbsp;&nbsp; for great coffee check out merlo.&nbsp; you'll probably smell the warehouse before you get there (which is what i did). they sell beans and will make you a free coffee to check out the beans.&nbsp; the factory is also in fortitude valley (104 mclachlan st i think). &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>sounds like a fantastic trip!!&nbsp; i'm jealous! jen&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/blog/dbarefoot/a-trip-round-ireland" title="A Trip Round Ireland">A Trip Round Ireland</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: dbarefoot on December 7, 2005 - 11:32am</div>

    <div class="content">

    <p><img vspace="3" hspace="3" align="left" src="/files/includes/images/9778671_9736ca2ed3_t.jpg" />Somebody recently emailed me with some questions on Ireland, knowing that I used to live in Dublin. Here are notes from my reply (links generally go to my photos or external sites):</p>        <ul>  <li>There&rsquo;s a ton to see in Dublin, both during the day and the evening. The guidebooks will no doubt give you the highlights, but don&rsquo;t miss a musical or literary pub crawl. They&rsquo;re for the tourists, obviously, but the calibre of performance is great. I&rsquo;ve blogged about <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/archives/001101.html">my other favourite places in Dublin</a>. Understand that Dublin and the rest of Ireland are remarkably different. The former is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dbarefoot/9778844/">a bustling, grimy city</a> with an amazing history and culture, while the rest of Ireland is all greenest-of-green hills, charming hamlets and gorgeous coastlines.</li>     <li>If you&rsquo;re in Dublin on Saturday, don&rsquo;t miss <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dbarefoot/search/tags:dublin/">the Temple Bar Market</a>. Have a crepe from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dbarefoot/9779687/">the hippy kids at the crepery cart</a>. Trust me, you won&rsquo;t regret it.</li><li>Top tip for North Americans: for the love of God, don't drive in Dublin. It's a medieval city with 21st century traffic nightmares. The city has a decent public transit system (be sure to check out their new tram system, <a href="http://www.luas.ie/">the Luas</a>), and the centre of the city is very walkable. Rent a car (be sure to specify an automatic if you can't drive standard) from the airport, which will enable you to skirt most of the nasty Dublin traffic. </li> <li> I'd suggest driving inland south from Dublin to Waterford. You'll see plenty of coast elsewhere, and this enables you to visit <a href="http://www.wicklow.com/glendalough/">Glendalough</a>, which is a lovely corner of the country. Then you can sneak across Carlow to Kilkenny, which is a great town. Then I'd either go down to Waterford or across through the <a href="http://www.comhaltas.com/bru/Cashel.htm">Rock of Cashel</a> (a pretty amazing spot) to Cork. I'd recommend the Cashel route, but either way is good.</li>      <li>Of course, if you're near Kilkenny, you could stop in at <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/FoulksrathCastle-Kilkenny-12396">my ancestral home</a>. Mind you, it's a hostel now, so don't try to reclaim it or anything. I already tried that, and two Swedish guys threw me out.</li>         <li>You surely know about the Ring of Kerry and the Dingle Peninsula--they're pretty famous.</li>       <li>Galway is definitely worth getting to, as is the western part of County Galway, known as Connemara. The landscape is strikingly different than the rest of the country.</li>       <li>Finally, don't miss the Aran Islands. They're gorgeous, a taste of old Ireland. You can rent bikes there, and ride around for the day.</li>  </ul><br class="clear" />

  I had lots of expectations built up about how beautiful Ireland would be, how friendly and fun.&nbsp; If I had just stayed in Dublin, I might&nbsp; have left Ireland disappointed.&nbsp; Instead we took the whole family on an &quot;adventure tour.&quot;&nbsp; We found the tour through their website:&nbsp;http://www.vagabond-ireland.com<div style="">Our guide was a hilarious Irish guy who truely knew the most beautiful, out of the way places on the Iveragh, the Beara and, yes, the Dingle Peninsulas. We saw ancient manner houses and castles and stone circles.&nbsp; We saw the most breathtaking vistas where the sea and mountains met.&nbsp; I feel so jealous of the sheep and cows who live on the hillsides with those views every day.</div><div style="">&nbsp;</div><br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/blog/supamanu/you-see-the-thing-about-france-is" title="You see, the thing about France is...">You see, the thing about France is...</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: supamanu on November 9, 2005 - 12:51am</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>...like everywhere else, you have to start by not passing judgement based on YOUR paradigm of &quot;how the world oughta be&quot;.</p><p>Warning: I am french. You might think I am biased, and you'd probably be right. Technically though I have spent more than half my life living outside of france, so I consider myself pretty broad minded and open to self criticism.</p><p>Now that I got that out of the way, let me share with you my own view of &quot;les francais&quot;, hoping that it will make your trip to france (assuming you are going there) all the more enjoyable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;First myth. The french aren't just &quot;rude&quot; to tourists. I also experience that apparent rudeness. Here I'm not talking about stock standard rudeness - that exists the world over, and particularly in big, busy cities like Paris where a lot of people can struggle with day to day existance and being nice is low on their list of priorities.<br /> </p><p>The &quot;rudeness&quot; I'm talking about is what you experience at that first interaction in a cafe, a shop, on the sidewalk etc.</p><p>The best way to put it is like this. The french don't believe that they should&nbsp; treat you in any special way because (a) you're a tourist and (b) you are spending money in their cafe/shop/country. The notion of 'customer service' is still in its infancy back home. YOU and the cafe waiter are on equal terms. Simple. The fact that your tip contributes to his wellbeing is more or less a given, his job, that's what I'm paid to do. So he will treat you like any stranger. And in france, that often starts with a bit of distance, testing you.</p><p>I can't begin to explain how many places I've been to where after a few tense words I found the 'hook' that turned a cold face into a warm smile, a hand laid on my shoulder, good hearted banter and a firm handshake at the end of the evening. There is no recipe for the 'hook', other than treating people respectfully and politely, acknowledging that they may have very good reasons for having a bad day, and being genuinely interested in who they are, and not what they do.</p><p>So here's my tip for the day. If you want to be pampered and 'yes sir right away' then I can think of a 100 better places to go than france. If you are ready to shed your pre-conceptions, take the rough with the smooth and treat people as equals even when they don't return the favour, I think you will experience a people that can surprise you, interest you, and treat you with a real kindness that will make your trip memorable.</p><br class="clear" />

  <p>Chile is definitely a place to visit. The good thing with this country is that, with 4000 kilometers long, you can see almost every landscape you can imagine, from the dryiest place on earth (Atacama desert) to the ice desert of &quot;Tierra del Fuego&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Land of Fire&quot;).</p><p><br /> If you plan to go there late 2006, I guess it's not warm enough to visit the southern part of Chile, the best season being January to March - summer season. I also recommend the 8th region and below (South and Far South regions), including Patagonia, Chiloe and the Lake region.</p><p><br /> I spent a few weeks visiting the Far North last year (June-July). Some places like San Pedro de Atacama are worth visiting. It's a cute little village in the middle of the Salar de Atacama. We stayed in Hotel Kimal (<a href="http://www.kimal.cl/index_i.htm" title="http://www.kimal.cl/index_i.htm">http://www.kimal.cl/index_i.htm</a>), a bit expensive but it has everything you need (and more: spa) and the osners are nice. There's a lot of tours organized for visitors: Valley of the Moon, Tatio Geysers, Salar de Atacama, and some volcanoes treckings. The Landscape is simply unbelievable.</p><p>Other places worth visiting up in the north are: Parinacota village (Lauca National Park, 1st Region), Humberstone salpeter works (<a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1178" title="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1178">http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1178</a>), Giant geoglyphs at Pintados, near Iquique.</p><p>I've posted the photos of this trip in my Flickr photosets: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/99155568@N00/sets/652441/" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/99155568@N00/sets/652441/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/99155568@N00/sets/652441/</a><br /> Let me know if you're deciding to go to Chile.<br /> </p><p>One last thing: Chileans are sooooo nice! I've never met such a nice people. They're always glad to help you.<br /></p><br class="clear" />

  <p>Zorbing is great.&nbsp; It's not something that you can really explain or try to compare to anything else, it's just fun.&nbsp; You get done at the bottom, you're soaking wet, smiling, laughing, and wanting to do it again.&nbsp; If you have any questions about things to do or see there, I've travelled throughout the country all tolled for over 7 months now.&nbsp; It's a fantastic place to be.&nbsp; For images, check out my website:&nbsp; <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/jasonkearns/nz" title="http://homepage.mac.com/jasonkearns/nz">http://homepage.mac.com/jasonkearns/nz</a> or email if you have any questions about things to do, places to stay, whathaveyou.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy!</p><br class="clear" />
