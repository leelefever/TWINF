      <h2><a href="/communism" title="On Communism">On Communism</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on December 28, 2006 - 10:31am</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p><i>I wrote this entry in September of 2006 from Helsinki, Finland just after arriving there from the Trans-Siberian Railway and a month in China.&nbsp; For a while I was consumed by learning about Communism and needed to get it on paper, so to speak.</i></p><hr size="2" width="100%" /><p class="MsoNormal">This post is a bit of a departure from the usual travel topics and I hope you&rsquo;ll pardon its serious and dark nature. Having been to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Czech Republic</st1:place></st1:country-region>, Communism seems to be a recurring theme and something to which I&rsquo;ve devoted a lot of time reading and learning. I&rsquo;ve developed a fascination for the subject, likely more than any other subject on the trip. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I figure that the root of my fascination is related to the fact that so many smart people believed in it so fervently and killed so many in an attempt to make it work &ndash; and the work continues to this day.<span>&nbsp; </span>To me as an American entrepreneur, Communism is endlessly fascinating because it diverges so greatly from my world view.<span>&nbsp; </span>The more I learn about it, the more baffled I become that so many could believe that it is a perfectly reasonable way to run a country.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I started the trip knowing very little about the Communist ideology, Marxism, Leninism or the history of the peoples&rsquo; revolution.<span>&nbsp; </span>After reading a number of books, visiting museums, etc., I think I have a handle on some of the basics.<span>&nbsp; </span>To test myself, I&rsquo;d like to try to describe my layman&#39;s version for you as briefly and simply as possible.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Karl Marx was known as the father of Communism and the author of the Communist Manifesto &ndash; the first declaration of his theory in late 19<sup>th</sup> century. To Marx, capitalism (free markets, supply and demand, etc.) was evil and would eventually cause great misery to the people of the world. His goal was to stop it.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">To understand why he thought this, we must consider the lives of workers in the Industrial Revolution of the 1800s.<span>&nbsp; </span>At the time he saw a world where people were either rich owners or exploited and unhappy workers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Marx saw this as a great injustice that was getting worse through the growth of Capitalism.<span>&nbsp; </span>He foresaw a future where Capitalism would create a small handful of rich people and a world of miserable people that would get more miserable over time. This would even be extended to a worldwide scale with the world eventually being run by a few rich industrialists. This was what some called Imperialism and it was the end game of Capitalism.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Marx was successful in convincing a lot of very smart and powerful people that his was the true vision of the world and his Communist ideology its savior.<span>&nbsp; </span>He promoted the idea that the true power of a civilization lies within the working class and if properly motivated, the working class can rise up in revolution against the rich land owners. This was revolution and it was the first stage of building a Communist system which would be fair to everyone &ndash; a single class society that worked to provide what it needed for the whole society. The government owned everything and everyone worked toward a common goal of self-sufficiency.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, according to the theory, there would be no need for government in the future &ndash; it would &ldquo;whither away&rdquo; as the Communist utopia was achieved. Everyone would be well fed, protected and happy as they worked together as one.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Of course, history shows that this is not the case.<span>&nbsp; </span>Two contributing factors:</p>    <ul style="margin-top: 0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal">Marx      got it wrong.<span>&nbsp; </span>He did not predict      the rapid rise of the middle class.<span>&nbsp;      </span>Before he died, he saw Capitalism creating opportunities for a new class      that were neither the rich owner nor the exploited worker.</li></ul>    <ul style="margin-top: 0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal">Marxism      was just a theory:<span>&nbsp; </span>It described how      things should work and what should happen, but it never described *how*      Communism or revolution should actually be managed.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was a theory with no doctrine. </li></ul>    <p class="MsoNormal">Of course in the 20<sup>th</sup> century there would be no shortage of world leaders to test the Marxist theory in the form of prompting a revolution and establishing a Communist government &ndash; supposedly freeing the working classes from Capitalist oppression.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The first serious revolutionary was Lenin in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>. He put Marxist theory into practice and established the first Communist government in 1917 and in doing so created Leninism &ndash; the way a person goes about revolution and enacting Marxist principles.<span>&nbsp; </span>This created what is known as Marxism/Leninism and became a complete package for people like Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh and Pol Pot in <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span>They now had the idea (Marxism) and the practice (Leninism) for Communist Revolution.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">What has happened since then is the subject of great debate. Most would agree that if there is a winner in the Cold War, it is Capitalism. Many questions remain about what went wrong with Communism.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ll let you research the myriad perspectives on what happened and leave you with my own admittedly half-baked answer.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I think there are two main reasons Communism failed.<span>&nbsp; </span>The first is human nature.<span>&nbsp; </span>Communism underestimated the human need for achievement, competition and recognition.<span>&nbsp; </span>Making everyone the same reduced everyone to the lowest common denominator and bred more misery and frustration than it prevented.<span>&nbsp; </span>The second reason is leadership.<span>&nbsp; </span>Have you ever heard of the founder of a company having to hire a CEO?<span>&nbsp; </span>It happens often because the people that start things are not often the best people to manage them.<span>&nbsp; </span>Revolutionaries are great at revolution, but can be poor at administration and management.<span>&nbsp; </span>The history of Communism is rife with stories of Mao, Stalin and Pol Pot making ludicrous decisions that caused the deaths of millions of their people.<span>&nbsp; </span>They grew omnipotent through revolution but lacked the skills to use that power in any responsible manner. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">My guess is that human history will show Communism as a destructive and deadly force in the world, not because of the idea or theory, but its implementation.<span>&nbsp; </span>It enabled the centralization of absolute power that bred mass corruption and quickly became unmanageable.<span>&nbsp; </span>To give you an idea of the level of destruction, consider the number of deaths in these countries in the Communist era:</p>    <ul style="margin-top: 0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal"><st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>      and Mao&rsquo;s Great Leap Forward (1950&rsquo;s)<span>&nbsp;      </span>- 30 million dead from starvation</li><li class="MsoNormal"><st1:country-region><st1:place>Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region>      and Pol Pot&rsquo;s Communist Revolution (1970&rsquo;s) 7 million dead from starvation      and executions (1 in 7 Cambodians)</li><li class="MsoNormal"><st1:country-region><st1:place>Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>      and Stalin&rsquo;s Iron Rule (1920-50s) &ndash; 40 million dead from starvation and      executions</li></ul>    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in">&hellip; and this is not counting the unquantifiable misery wrought on families and individuals in these countries as secret police, hidden agendas and propaganda were a fact of life.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">Could a system of government that produced numbers like this be considered a positive force in the world?<span>&nbsp; </span>I think not. Yet, the Communist Party is still a major player in world politics.<span>&nbsp; </span>In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> it has considerable power and of course in <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>North   Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region> it is the dominant force. How could this be? How could there still be demand for such a system?<span>&nbsp; </span>The answer lies somewhere in the real world security and equality that Communism provides the working class.<span>&nbsp; </span>Despite the horrific past, some people still yearn for a system where they can depend on the government for everything &ndash; they are ready to trade freedom for security.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Maybe the real root of my fascination with Communism is related to how it helps me to understand all the things I take for granted.<span>&nbsp; </span>The more I learn, the more I wonder what my life would be like if I was a child of Communism.<span>&nbsp; </span>With an entrepreneurial American worldview, I find it nearly unfathomable.</p><p class="MsoNormal">For more reading, check out the Wikipedia entries on:&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism">Communism</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong">Mao Zedong</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_pot">Pol Pot</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx">Karl Marx</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx">Marxism</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism">Capitalism</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism">Dictatorship of the Proleteriat</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism">Imperialism</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />

On the morning of the 8th, I got up early, like a kid on Christmas, to see the early results and went back to bed with satisfied thoughts of a Democratic House and the defeat of Rick Santorum in Pennsylvania.  Since then, we&#39;ve been checking in on the headlines, but I think we both miss the analysis (which I imagine most Americans are already sick of).  More than anything else, I want to be able to watch The Daily Show with Jon Stewart right now and experience something close to the moment we all hoped for in 2004.  I&#39;m sure he has a lot to say.<br /><br /> The election is of course huge news here too.  One of the guys that runs the hotel here said it is the top story on the radio, newspaper, TV, etc.  From what we&#39;ve heard many, many times on the trip, we think this election will make some sense to the Europeans.  Most of our friends in Europe were completely baffled by Bush being elected a second time.  They often say that it seems impossible because they have never met an American that likes him.  Our response is usually something like &quot;Well, remember that something like 80% of Americans do not hold a passport&quot;.<br /><br /> We both will take some satisfaction in returning home to a government with a different agenda and with a not-so-subtle message having been sent to W from our countrymen.  Home is looking better all the time. </p><br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/holland" title="Sex and Drugs in Liberal Holland">Sex and Drugs in Liberal Holland</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on October 14, 2006 - 3:58am</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>I described Amsterdam to my Mom as &quot;A bastion of hedonism&quot;.&nbsp; Sure, it has beautiful canals, nice people, amazing sights, about a billion bicycles and a ton of charm, but what is truly impressive about Amsterdam and what differentiates it on a worldwide scale is the liberal policies of the Dutch government concerning drugs and prostitution.</p><p>For instance, we stayed in a guesthouse in the Red Light District and within two blocks of our guesthouse, anyone with the money can <i>legally</i> buy &quot;soft drugs&quot; like marijuana, mushrooms and hashish in small quantities and sexual services from a host of licensed prostitutes who display their wares in large windows under red lights.&nbsp; I suppose you could also see some music and complete the hedonists triumverate of sex, drugs <i>and</i> rock-n-roll.</p><p>The view from our place:</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/108-269097325_1760c0157f.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /></p><p>Coming from George W.&#39;s America, this all seems quite surreal. Surely these things must be causing all sorts of social ills. As it turns out, the Dutch policy is quite calculated and appears to be surprisingly healthy for the country compared to other EU countries.&nbsp;</p><p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_the_Netherlands">wikipedia</a>:</p><p><span class="blockquote">Most policymakers in the Netherlands believe that if a problem has proved to be unsolvable, it is better to try controlling it instead of continuing to enforce laws with mixed results.</span>This means that the sale of sex and drugs are regulated and taxed, ensuring as much safety as possible and that the government can benefit from the revenue.&nbsp; Further, it means that the government can exert control when it is needed. But, what about drug abuse?&nbsp; Doesn&#39;t the availability increase the instances of abuse?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently not.&nbsp; Through <a href="http://stats05.emcdda.europa.eu/en/elements/gpstab08a-en.html">studies completed</a> across the EU since 2000, The Netherlands ranks 7th in the use of marijuana - after Cyprus Spain, the UK, France, Germany and Italy.&nbsp; The prevalance is similar for other <a href="http://stats05.emcdda.europa.eu/en/elements/gpstab09a-en.html">types of drugs</a>. </p><p>For the visitor to Amsterdam, these elements of the city can be surprising and intimidating - we talked to some people who would not step foot into the Red Light District. However, I think it is more surprising that the city doesn&#39;t have the overall feel of a &quot;bad neighborhood&quot; with a high frequency of drugs, sex shops and prostitutes.&nbsp; There is a ragged and depressing element to the Red Light District, but I don&#39;t think it is much different than any other city - it is just that tourists are exposed and invited to participate in activities that would otherwise be managed in dark alleys and controlled by criminals instead of government agencies. <br /></p><p>The Dutch policy seems based on the idea that people are going to do what they are going to do, regardless of the government or the potential for punishment.&nbsp; And if this is true, their only tools are regulation, taxation and tolerance.&nbsp; It makes sense to me and the Dutch folks we talked to about it.   </p><br class="clear" />

    <p class="MsoNormal">Growing up in a time when the fall of the <st1:place>Soviet  Union</st1:place> came in my formative years (born:1973), I saw the Hammer and Sickle as a relic of a bygone era of Communism.

After Communism failed to produce results, the country became Socialist in the 80&rsquo;s and started to open the country to a free market economy.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, today the Communist Party is still operating and has significant power in the Vietnamese government.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, I imagine this has something to do with the prevalence of the hammer and sickle.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/71-195252640_b45fb6213e.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">I asked a tour guide about the difference it made to have a free market economy and I may never for get his response.<span>&nbsp; </span>He said &ldquo;<i>For 10 years in Communist government, I have only one shirt and wear it every day.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now, I wear different shirt every day.</i>&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>That example said volumes to me.&nbsp; I&#39;ll be interested to see how it is China and Russia, both coming up on the itinerary soon. </p>  <br class="clear" />

I was interested to know his story.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 1975 he was 2 years old (same as me) when Pol Pot came to power.<span>&nbsp; </span>His father, a physician, was immediately separated from the family after being identified by his profession.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dom never saw his father again.<span>&nbsp; </span>The systematic execution of intellectuals was a strategy implemented by the Khmer Rouge.<span>&nbsp; </span>People who were deemed to be educated were potential enemies and enemies had to be &ldquo;smashed to bits&rdquo;.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the regime finally crumbled, some estimates conclude that there were only seven physicians left in all of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region> - seven doctors out of 7 million people.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Year Zero</b></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Pol Pot&rsquo;s goal was to turn <st1:country-region><st1:place>Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region> upside down and into an agrarian society.<span>&nbsp; </span>According to his plan, the population would work to produce crops that would be exported to bring in money to fund social products and industry.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is why money, schools and religion were banned- they were not needed for farming. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region> would revert to a pre-industrial backward-looking culture.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">In talking to Cambodians I heard a theme regarding the Pol Pot time that related to starting over from &ldquo;Year Zero&rdquo;.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m only starting to grasp what it means for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region> to start over from Year Zero.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once Pol Pot had been driven out, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region> started to rebuild, but found that the very means to rebuild had been eliminated.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hospitals had no workers, schools had no teachers, government had no administrators &ndash; the cornerstones of modern society had been systematically eliminated.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Khmer Rouge had murdered a generation of people that could have worked to speed the country&rsquo;s recovery.<span>&nbsp; </span>Instead they were left with former soldiers, rural farmers and broken families to rebuild a country that was &ldquo;revolutionized&rdquo; into the stone ages.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The more I learn about the Khmer Rouge the more unbelievable it seems and I get the feeling that Cambodians that are my age feel the same.&nbsp; I don&#39;t get a sense of anger or hatred as much as disbelief. From my own perspective I cannot get past the fact that Pol Pot and his cadre were absolutely convinced that their plan would <i>actually</i> work and would be a <i>good</i> thing for the country.<span>&nbsp; </span>Simply unfathomable.</p>  <br class="clear" />
