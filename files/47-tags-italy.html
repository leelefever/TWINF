They may tell you at Day Light Savings Time to change your clocks at 2am on Sunday morning - but don&#39;t listen to the propaganda.  That hour is *your* hour and you can use it how you like.  Maybe you&#39;d prefer to use it right after breakfast and have extra time to read the paper.  Maybe you want to sleep an hour later or go to bed an hour earlier.  My advice is to use it wisely.<br /><br /> For instance, one time Sachi and I waited almost 6 whole days to use an hour of day light savings time.  We rented a car in Italy and arrived in Rome on a Friday.  On Saturday we met our friend Robin and had a highlight of a day.  For the next 5 days we travelled up the Italian coast and finally back to Milan to catch a train to Geneva.  When we reached the station on the following Thursday, we noticed something perplexing: the train station clock displayed a time that was one full hour earlier than our watches.  How could this be?<br /><br /> As it turns out, the time changed the prior Saturday at 2am - 5 days prior.  We had been living in a world that was an hour before us the whole time and had no clue. With no where else to go, we huddled outside an espresso cafe, sat on our bags and spent the hour, OUR hour, shivering as we watched the minutes tick past before boarding our train.  This was not a good way to spend our hour and I hope will serve as a reminder to others. </p><br class="clear" /><div class="links"><a href="/user/login?destination=node/1118%2523comment_form"></a> <a href="/user/register?destination=node/1118%2523comment_form"></a></div><h2 class="title">Remaindered Italy Photos</h2> by <a href="/profile/leelefever" title="View user profile.">leelefever</a> <small>(<a href="/general" rel="tag" title="">General</a> | <a href="/tags/italy" rel="tag" title="" class="active">italy</a> | <a href="/tags/photos" rel="tag" title="">photos</a> | <a href="/tags/town" rel="tag" title="">town</a>)</small><br /><p>We saw a lot on the latter part of our road trip in Italy, but moving around so fast it&#39;s hard to say too much.&nbsp; Luckily photos say more than we can (some say up to 1000 words!)

China, Vietnam and many other unexpected places make it a smooth, albeit paperwork laden,  operation.<br /><br /> In Italy, where some things are so well designed and easy, the postal system seems to be a mess - at least for the traveler.<br /><br /> We needed to send home about 10 lbs of items and, as usual, found the post office near the train station in Milan.  After waiting for 20 minutes, they could only sell us an oversized yellow box and the basic direction of another post office where we could send it.  So, with our backpacks and a giant yellow box, we walked to the other station and waited again.  It looked bad.  There were 6 windows all blocked by glass - no place to pass over a big box.  With a help of a very friendly Italian guy, we finally communicated that we wanted to send the box to America.  At this point, she looked at us like we requested an express package to the moon.  Neither post office was set up for sending packages - only items that could be slid under the glass sneeze guard.   I wonder how Italians send a package?<br /><br /> When she asked about the contents of our giant yellow box, my translator communicated that one item was pasta.  She shook her head and had to look up if it was OK to send pasta to the US.  I just wanted to say &quot;We&#39;re in Italy right?  Is pasta a protected item here?  Is the US concerned about ecological effects foreign pasta? C&#39;mon&quot;<br /><br /> After a lot of talking in Italian, it became clear that our 10lbs of goods would cost USD 90 and about 500 dollars of pure hassle.  Our translator left us with solace by saying that even for Italians, the post office is always an adventure.  Fortunately for them though, they don&#39;t have to schlep around 10 extra pounds wherever they go when it doesn&#39;t work out.  Maybe it&#39;ll be easier in France. </p><br class="clear" /><div class="links"><a href="/poste-italiane#comment" title="Jump to the first comment of this posting.">4 comments</a></div><h2 class="title">On Love and Gelato</h2> by <a href="/profile/leelefever" title="View user profile.">leelefever</a> <small>(<a href="/general" rel="tag" title="">General</a> | <a href="/tags/food" rel="tag" title="">food</a> | <a href="/tags/italy" rel="tag" title="" class="active">italy</a> | <a href="/tags/rome" rel="tag" title="">rome</a>)</small><br /><style type="text/css"> .flickr-photo { border: solid 2px #000000; } .flickr-yourcomment { } .flickr-frame { text-align: left; padding: 3px; } .flickr-caption { font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 0px; } </style>  <div class="flickr-frame"> 	<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leelefever/284846577/" title="photo sharing"><img src="/files/includes/images/118-284846577_f8459218ed_m.jpg" class="flickr-photo" /></a> <br /> 	<span class="flickr-caption"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leelefever/284846577/">On Love and Gelato</a>, originally uploaded by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/leelefever/">LeeLeFever_TwinF</a>.</span> </div> 				 <p class="flickr-yourcomment"> 	All gelato is not made equal.  Its hard to tell until that first lick - when it desolves and leaves a sweet silky smooth taste in your mouth. You can feel the love when it&#39;s real.  Today I met my new favorite - pine nut ice cream.  I&#39;m still feelin the love.<br /><br />  In fact, we&#39;re both feeling a lot of love in Italy.  Florence, Rome, Siena, San Gimignano, Lucca and tomorrow Cinque Terre - its all so amazingly rich.  Culture, art, food, architecture, people, cars, colors, smells - the Italians do it differently and we like it - a lot.<br /><br /> Unfortunately we haven&#39;t made time for uploading pics and videos, but they are coming soon.  Until then, enjoy Halloween and remember to vote in a week (if your in the US)!  We totally dropped the ball for absentee ballots. </p><br class="clear" /><div class="links"><a href="/user/login?destination=node/1082%2523comment_form"></a> <a href="/user/register?destination=node/1082%2523comment_form"></a></div><h2 class="title">Italian Halloween</h2> by <a href="/profile/leelefever" title="View user profile.">leelefever</a> <small>(<a href="/general" rel="tag" title="">General</a> | <a href="/tags/humor" rel="tag" title="">humor</a> | <a href="/tags/italy" rel="tag" title="" class="active">italy</a> | <a href="/tags/rome" rel="tag" title="">rome</a>)</small><br /><style type="text/css"> .flickr-photo { border: solid 2px #000000; } .flickr-yourcomment { } .flickr-frame { text-align: left; padding: 3px; } .flickr-caption { font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 0px; } </style>  <div class="flickr-frame"> 	<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leelefever/281209348/" title="photo sharing"><img src="/files/includes/images/90-281209348_a1f8393509_m.jpg" class="flickr-photo" /></a> <br /> 	<span class="flickr-caption"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leelefever/281209348/">Italian Halloween</a>, originally uploaded by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/leelefever/">LeeLeFever_TwinF</a>.</span> </div> 				 <p class="flickr-yourcomment"> 	I&#39;m not so sure this costume would go over too well in the US.

When Rome came up on the itinerary, I looked forward to seeing Robin and he has been an amazing host.  Last night we had a great dinner in the neighborhood where he grew up (near the Vatican).  As an added bonus, we got aquainted with what he called &quot;Tobasco Place&quot;, where he and his friends used to dance alone at 3am to Earth Wind and Fire on top of columns around Castle St. Angelo back in the day.  From the picture above, you can tell Robin is full of personality and spice - I could totally see him busting a move out there.  Today we get on motorbikes with his brother to &quot;see places no tourist sees&quot;.
