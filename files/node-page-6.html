    <div class="info">By: leelefever on November 17, 2006 - 9:43am</div>
    <div class="content">
  <p>Sachi and I were just minding our business at a cafe in the Barri Gothic of Barcelona, just off the Ramblas on Ferran. I looked out the window and glanced up at a hip-looking guy with a bag slung across his shoulder and a head of huge curly hair.&nbsp; In knew in an instant that it was <a href="http://gladwell.typepad.com/">Malcolm Gladwell</a>, New Yorker writer and popular author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tipping-Point-Little-Things-Difference/dp/0316346624/ref=pd_sim_b_1/104-7078145-5287912">The Tipping Point</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blink-Power-Thinking-Without/dp/0316172324/sr=8-1/qid=1163786896/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-7078145-5287912?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">Blink</a>.&nbsp; Being one of my favorite authors and a blogger, I knew his look and seemed nearly unmistakable as he walked by.&nbsp; Then, just as I mentioned to Sachi that it looked like him, he came into our cafe and sat down across the room from us. </p><p>How random! How often could that possibly happen - even in New York? But in Barcelona it was almost surreal. I had to investigate. </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/122-299531013_d0f03bfa0d.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>After we finished lunch I walked over to him, a bit nervously and feeling a little intrusive and said &quot;Are you Malcolm?&quot;&nbsp; He smiled and said &quot;yes!&quot; and I introduced myself and Sachi.&nbsp; We talked a bit about why he was in Barcelona (a speaking engagement at a conference) and our trip.&nbsp; He was surprised that Sachi and I are still on good terms after nearly a year. I tried to resist the urge, but I ended up doing the ultimate fanboy action and asking for a picture with him - I just had to.&nbsp; Malcolm was completely gracious about it and seemed like any other nice guy you&#39;d meet on the street - in Barcelona.&nbsp; Good guy that Malcolm.&nbsp; After a bit of small talk we left him with his hand written notebook and coffee.&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t help but wonder - is that his next book?&nbsp; Maybe it&#39;s about chance meetings. </p><br class="clear" />

It is an art form and there are incredibly talented people who do their work with aerosol cans and public walls.&nbsp; Unfortunately, these are the exceptions.&nbsp; 99% of the graffiti we&rsquo;ve seen is not an attempt at art, but what appears to be late-night scribbles by disaffected individuals that wish to state publicly their discontent with politics, football, the environment, their personal lives, etc.&nbsp; This is the sad and ugly graffiti that plagues <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/112-296304503_6eae712317.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">There is of course, a beautiful side as we saw in <st1:city><st1:place>Paris</st1:place></st1:city> and <st1:city><st1:place>Lisbon</st1:place></st1:city>.&nbsp; Stencil graffiti, works done by spraying paint over a pre-cut piece of paper or cardboard,&nbsp; can produce artful, beautiful and interesting visual experiences.&nbsp; This is the graffiti I respect.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/100-293093914_342fd453be.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://jefaerosol.free.fr/">Jef Aerosol</a>,&nbsp; in <st1:city><st1:place>Paris</st1:place></st1:city> has been doing stencil graffiti in <st1:city><st1:place>Paris</st1:place></st1:city> for a few years and we ran across some of his works just off Rue Mouffetard in the <st1:place>Latin  Quarter</st1:place>.&nbsp; </p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/114-293093919_66cef2c41b.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">In <st1:city><st1:place>Lisbon</st1:place></st1:city> we saw a few pieces that I really enjoyed &ndash; particularly this one of the painter covering himself.&nbsp; </p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/119-296305011_228e9581b8.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">A few others struck me too.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/107-296293431_287cb41262.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">In <st1:city><st1:place>Seattle</st1:place></st1:city>, where graffiti is also a problem, there is a city law that business owners must cover graffiti within a set amount of days or face fines.&nbsp; As it turns out, <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> has similar laws and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region> has led the way with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Social_Behaviour_Act_2003">Anti-Social Behavior Act of 2003</a> which was is similar to a piece of potential EU legislation with the aim to:</p>    <p class="MsoNormal blockquote">&hellip;eliminate dirt, litter, graffiti, animals&#39; excrement and excessive noise from domestic and vehicular music systems in European cities, along with other concerns over urban life.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The sad reality from our perspective is that graffiti appears to be taking over the walls of <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>&rsquo;s cities.&nbsp; Art, beauty, or not, I hope that something can be done because the experience of the visitor to these historic places is being altered in a way that reflects a feeling of degradation or mis-care.&nbsp; It appears that some cities are taking on the look of a &ldquo;bad neighborhood&rdquo; and nobody wants that.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes though, graffiti has a way of stating something that just wouldn&#39;t be as appropriate any other way...</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/113-296292913_ec5f2ffe7e.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/foreignness" title="A European Sort of Foreigness">A European Sort of Foreigness</a></h2>
    <div class="info">By: leelefever on November 12, 2006 - 3:47am</div>
    <div class="content">
    <p class="MsoNormal">One of my friends recently sent an instant message that said &ldquo;<st1:country-region><st1:place>France</st1:place></st1:country-region> seems boring compared to the other places you&rsquo;ve been on the trip <span style="font-family: Wingdings"><span>J</span></span>&rdquo;. He was only kidding and it was a compliment in some ways, but I know what he is talking about.<span>&nbsp; </span>I wasn&rsquo;t too excited about <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span>I had been twice before and it seemed a little boring and easy compared to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Mongolia</st1:place></st1:country-region> or <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> for instance.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Fortunately the reality has been much different.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have enjoyed and been captivated by <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> more than I ever expected.<span>&nbsp; </span>Despite being very much on the beaten track, I&rsquo;ve found it to have an authenticity that I didn&rsquo;t find as much in <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>, or at least it is more cleverly disguised.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">One of the major factors in the difference between <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> and <st1:place>Asia</st1:place> is the degree to which travelers live in the world of the locals.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have found that the more I can experience the world of the local, the more interesting a place seems.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m not talking about hanging out in a Vietnamese pool hall or a Chinese cockfight &ndash; I mean the everyday reality of grocery stores and coffee shops.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">For example, in <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>, being a white foreigner is an inescapable part of the experience. Because of the way we look, we are treated a different way.<span>&nbsp; </span>Our world is governed by what the country has learned about dealing with tourists.<span>&nbsp; </span>From their perspective, we only want to eat certain food, stay in certain hotels, use certain toilets and see the important temples.<span>&nbsp; </span>This forces travelers into a bubble in places like <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> where the experience is well planned and every need is accommodated for.<span>&nbsp; </span>For travelers like us, this is disappointing because if you don&rsquo;t work to get out of the bubble, you&rsquo;ll never see the real world.<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> without a little struggle for the foreigner is not the real world <st1:country-region><st1:place>Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">This is also true from an economic perspective.<span>&nbsp; </span>The average Thai person cannot afford to experience the world of the western traveler inside <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp; </span>This enables Thai tourism to focus on the western experience instead of trying to accommodate both Thai and western tastes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Few westerners visit <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region> and stay in places that are frequented by Thai locals.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, the experience is a westernized bubble version of the real world <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Wonderful still, just not the real world.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Turning to <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>, the situation is very different for us.<span>&nbsp; </span>Coming from very similar backgrounds and socio economic classes, we blend in with the European travelers &ndash; we stay in the same hotels, eat the same food and use the same toilets as everyone else.<span>&nbsp; </span>The locals usually have no idea where we are from or what expectations we may have for service or facilities. We often get questions as if we *are* locals. This makes <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> more foreign than <st1:place>Asia</st1:place> in many ways.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">When we visited the very familiar-seeming <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>, we found that many of the basic everyday facilities were more foreign than we encountered in <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Remote controls, window blinds, showers, heaters, elevators, door handles were different in a uniquely German way. <span>&nbsp;</span>Further, while the people often speak English, few public facilities cater to English speakers. Germany never had to create an environment for tourists from another hemisphere &ndash; they never built the bubble to make travelers feel safe.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Without the bubble, the experience is more real.<span>&nbsp; </span>We experience <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>, an economically similar country to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>, in the same way that the French, Japanese, Chinese or Brazilian travelers do.<span>&nbsp; </span>The <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region> we experience is the real <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region> and it seems to be a uniquely foreign experience that we didn&rsquo;t find as much in <st1:place>Asia</st1:place> where every country has learned how to cater to the westerners.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">In short, <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> has been surprising because the reality of the traveler&rsquo;s experience is so much more closely matched to the reality of the local world.</p>  <br class="clear" />

Then, we would use busses and trains to make our way to Barcelona via Granada and Valencia over a couple of weeks (quite slowly as it takes forever by train).<br /><br /> Long story short, tonight we are near the French border in the coastal village of Cadaqu&eacute;s, Spain, northeast of Barcelona - very far from Portugal (in fact a flight, train and bus ride from Portugal).<br /><br /> In a few short hours our plans changed completely when we realized that the prospect of more day-to-day travel sounded a bit too much.  We&#39;ve been rolling through cities every few days for months and we need a vacation from the constant travel if we&#39;re going to make it to Christmas.  So we bagged our plans, got flights to Barcelona and rented an apartment for a couple of weeks.  We &quot;move in&quot; to our Gothic barrio apartment  on Sunday which gives us a weekend in Costa Brava and Cadaqu&eacute;s - the home of Salvador Dali.<br /><br /> We&#39;re both excited about Barcelona and some time to take in a city for more than a few days.  We&#39;ll have a kitchen, washer and dryer and the closest thing to home we&#39;ve seen in a very long time. Aahhhhhhh.<br /><br /> (The photo above is a Spanish guitarist we just saw perform tonight in Cadaqu&eacute;s). </p><br class="clear" />

On the morning of the 8th, I got up early, like a kid on Christmas, to see the early results and went back to bed with satisfied thoughts of a Democratic House and the defeat of Rick Santorum in Pennsylvania.  Since then, we&#39;ve been checking in on the headlines, but I think we both miss the analysis (which I imagine most Americans are already sick of).  More than anything else, I want to be able to watch The Daily Show with Jon Stewart right now and experience something close to the moment we all hoped for in 2004.  I&#39;m sure he has a lot to say.<br /><br /> The election is of course huge news here too.  One of the guys that runs the hotel here said it is the top story on the radio, newspaper, TV, etc.  From what we&#39;ve heard many, many times on the trip, we think this election will make some sense to the Europeans.  Most of our friends in Europe were completely baffled by Bush being elected a second time.  They often say that it seems impossible because they have never met an American that likes him.  Our response is usually something like &quot;Well, remember that something like 80% of Americans do not hold a passport&quot;.<br /><br /> We both will take some satisfaction in returning home to a government with a different agenda and with a not-so-subtle message having been sent to W from our countrymen.  Home is looking better all the time. </p><br class="clear" />

Yesterday we stopped by an Internet cafe in Lisbon to check in on the mid-term US elections (Yay!) and found an email from our <a href="/47/groffs">friend in France, JF Groff</a>.  JF had contacted his friend <a href="http://blog.delaranja.com/">Andre in Lisbon</a> (whom he met at a tech conference) and alerted him of our arrival.  In turn, Andre contacted us with an offer to get together in his hometown. I got Andre&#39;s phone number and within a few hours we went from being alone and wandering to experiencing Lisbon with Andre and his girlfriend <a href="http://cor.delaranja.com/">Batixa</a> in their 4 door <a href="/47/smart_car">Smart car</a>.<br /><br /> From their favorite pizzeria to gourmet desserts and a bit of nighttime sightseeing, Lisbon became a different place for us - and all we did was check email.<br /><br /> Andre and Beatrice, thanks so much for taking the time to hang out with us for a night - we had a blast and count you as great friends.  I&#39;ll remember too that Portuguese dogs say &quot;&Atilde;o! &Atilde;o!&quot; </p><br class="clear" />
