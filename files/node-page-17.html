    <p>Last week in Chiang Mai, we took a couple of days of cooking classes and met a couple from the Bay Area named <a href="http://bigkatamari.blogspot.com/">Nadav and Anya</a>.&nbsp; Through some chit-chat we discovered that they have been on a journey similar to ours, including a few days on the Thai island of Phi Phi.</p>  <p>After the class was over, we got an email from Nadav and this is what it said:</p>  <p><span class="blockquote">So nice to meet you today...As it turns out, we&#39;ve been reading your blog for about a week already. We were looking for information on Phi Phi, did a google blogsearch and found you! Thanks to your post, we decided to go. Thanks for the recommendation! Best wishes, and happy trails</span> How cool! I&#39;m excited that we were able to point these guys to <a href="/ko_phi_phi">something we enjoyed</a>, but also I think it is great that we can use this little site to encourage people to visit a beautiful place that really needs more help (in the form of tourist dollars) recovering from the tsunami. </p>  <br class="clear" />

  <p>In Chiang Mai, we were offered two options to get to Luang Prabang, Laos. The slow boat would take a couple of days where you sit on a wooden plank for 10 hours per day and can&#39;t lean back on the metal siding because the sun makes it too hot to touch (though we&#39;ve heard varied stories). Or fly in 50 minutes on Lao Airlines. We chose to fly.</p><p>As the plane <i>took off</i> I read our Rough Guide to Southeast Asia&#39;s instructions for getting around by planes. Here&#39;s what I read to Lee:</p><p class="blockquote">Most Western embassies still have travel advisories warning against flying Lao airlines. For some travellers flying Lao Airlines demonstrates bravado, but it&#39;s not really something you want to do unless you absolutely have to.&nbsp;</p><p>We made it just fine.

	I wish I could say that I thought the US played well in their final chance to advance in this World Cup, but I can't.  The US lost to Ghana 2-1 in an ugly and mostly uneventful match to match their other matches. One real goal in the whole cup?  Sheesh.<br /><br />
Ghana didn't perform as well as they did against the Czechs, but it was enough to move, with Italy, to the next round.  All I can say is...Go Ghana! They beat both of the top teams in their group who happened to both be FIFA top five teams. I would love to be in Africa right now where there is surely a party going on.

    <div class="info">By: <a href="/profile/leelefever" title="View user profile.">leelefever</a> on June 22, 2006 - 3:48am</div>
    <div class="content">
    <p class="MsoNormal">Among travelers to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region> (myself included) and readers of posts like this, a few questions come to mind. They include: </p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>Should we be riding around on elephants?<span>&nbsp; </span>Isn&rsquo;t the elephant being exploited? Is it inhumane for elephants to be used for tourism?</i></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Of course we all wish the elephants could live in the wild and be undisturbed by humans.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, for about the <a href="http://www.thailandelephant.org/eng/article.php3?no=12">last 4500 years</a>, elephants have been captured, domesticated and used for transportation, labor and even warfare.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For thousands of years, the elephant has been living with and around humans and over that time we humans have learned the requirements for ensuring that the relationship is stable and productive.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of the outgrowths of these years of domestication is the <a href="http://www.thaipro.com/detailed/99999/Thailand_elephant_Thai_mahout.htm">role of mahout</a>, which is the elephant&rsquo;s trainer- an essential and vital role for the elephant and human.<span>&nbsp; </span>For the last three days, I learned a little about being a mahout and his relationship with the elephant. These are mahouts with their elephants at the <a href="http://www.changthai.com/">Thai&nbsp; Elephant Conservation Center</a>:</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/46-172559006_7259f1cc6e.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The mahout has a unique relationship with the elephant- one that can last decades.<span>&nbsp; </span>When an elephant is born into domestication, it is assigned a mahout who will be responsible for the elephant for the mahout&rsquo;s whole life.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, some elephants outlive their mahouts (elephants can live 80+ years) and the elephant is then often passed down to the mahout&rsquo;s son. As you might imagine, a strong bond develops between the mahout and the elephant that goes beyond trainer and animal.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I asked about the nature of the relationship, it was described as companionship.<span>&nbsp; </span>The elephant seeks the company of the mahout and feels at home with the mahout on his back- they are a lifelong team.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">As I <a href="/47/mahout">experienced</a>, the relationship is not one purely of hugs and treats.<span>&nbsp; </span>As dog owners know, a dog seeks to be the alpha (dominant) dog in the family and if it perceives that it has reached this role, it will become less trainable and try to dominate the humans. The same basic idea is true with the elephants.<span>&nbsp; </span>The mahout must maintain a relationship with the elephant that ensures that the elephant is not dominant, but submissive to the mahout.<span>&nbsp; </span>A dominant elephant can be lethal. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">How do you dominate an elephant?<span> </span>Unfortunately, is partially through pain, or at least the threat of pain.<span>&nbsp; </span>Elephants are incredible heavy, strong, willful and tough animals. In order for the mahout to be able to train the elephant, he must have some way to send positive and negative messages.<span>&nbsp; </span>Along with voice commands and touching, the tool of choice for mahouts is an ominous looking pointed metal hook called an ankus. This hook is used to guide the elephant and to correct poor behavior.<span>&nbsp; </span>Though it seems a bit barbaric to the layperson, this evolved over many years and ensures that the elephant and mahout have mutual respect.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/67-172560777_7881c48137.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /><o:p> <br /></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">For hundreds of years in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region>, elephants were domesticated for working in the logging industry.<span>&nbsp; </span>Their mahouts <a href="http://www.chiangmai-thai.com/elephant.htm">trained them to do</a> the heavy lifting required in moving logs.<span>&nbsp; </span>While not necessarily a happy existence for the animals, it ensured that the mahout could have money to feed and care for the elephant. In 1989 the Thai government banned commercial logging in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region>. This event left many mahouts and elephants unemployed and forced some onto the streets of <st1:city><st1:place>Bangkok</st1:place></st1:city>. Keeping an unemployed elephant fed and cared-for is no easy task and often means disaster for the mahout and his family. Suddenly, the elephants became more of a liability than a source of income and many elephants were abandoned or killed in a sad turn of events.<span>&nbsp; Today there are <a href="http://www.phuket.com/conservation/elephants.htm">between 3-5000 elephants in Thailand</a> (domestic and wild) and their numbers are falling about 3% a year.&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Today, many elephants have found a new home by working in the eco-tourism industry.<span>&nbsp; </span>Elephants that are sufficiently trained and mild-mannered can now be supported through tourism.<span>&nbsp; </span>By offering rides through the jungle, elephant shows and elephant education, the mahouts and their elephants can support themselves without the logging industry.<span>&nbsp; </span>For many elephants, working conditions are greatly improved and as more tourists come to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region> more elephants can be supported.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The <a href="http://www.changthai.com/"><st1:place><st1:placename>Thai</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Elephant</st1:placename>  <st1:placename>Conservation</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place></a> was created by the government to educate the public about elephants and works to ensure their survival in the future.<span>&nbsp; </span>Part of the center&rsquo;s mission is to promote the elephant as an element of eco-tourism- an element that is healthy, sustainable and promotes increased understanding of the animals.<span>&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, a lot of work needs to be done.<span>&nbsp; </span>Elephant numbers are declining and there are many sick and starving elephants in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region> with no means of support.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>So, to return to the original questions&hellip;</b></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><i>Should we be riding around on these animals?<span>&nbsp; </span>Isn&rsquo;t the elephant being exploited?

  <p>I can&#39;t say I had ever talked to a monk.&nbsp; We see them a lot in Thailand, with their orange robes, shaved heads and quant smiles.&nbsp; I have been curious about monks and buddhism for a while and this was my chance to learn about their daily life.&nbsp; </p><p>The MCU Buddhist University in Chiang Mai has a program called <a href="http://www.monkchat.net/">Monk Chat</a>, where laypeople such as myself can go and talk to monks for a bit in a relaxed environment. The monks are all students at the University, which has the longest name evar: <font color="#008080"><font size="2">Mahachulalongkornrajvidalaya Buddhist University.</font></font></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/77-169532017_131220baf2.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>I had the pleasure of meeting Souk (above), who is from Loas and in his 4th year at the university.&nbsp; His English as very good (the program is, in part, meant to help their English) and he was no different that the nice guy you&#39;d meet in the street.&nbsp; In fact, he takes great pride in presenting himself with humor and laughter as it enables people (like me) to feel more comfortable in his presence.&nbsp; I talked for about an hour with Souk and his friends and got a feel for their student life, which involves a lot of early mornings and meditation.&nbsp; He knows more about the World Cup than me and seems to be more of a typical college student than I would have thought.&nbsp; He imparted some of his philosophy in saying that as a monk, there a number of rules, but the most important thing is to do good and serve as a positive example. I consider Souk a friend and I hope he is reading this. Hi Souk!<br /></p><p>Monk Chat occurs every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 5-7 pm. The University is beside Wat Suan Dok, which is nice for a visit as well. I recommend it wholeheartedly. </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/45-169532134_20e870a4f4.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="148" width="500" /></p><br class="clear" />

The Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej is celebrating 60 years on the throne (making him the world&#39;s longest serving monarch) and this event has the Thai people entranced.  A couple of nights ago, the King welcomed royalty from over 25 countries to his palace for a gala and it seemed that every Thai TV in the country tuned in for the event.  As we learned the next day, it was extremely rare for the people to see their beloved King, even on TV. As one restaurant manager explained to us &quot;everyone is just so happy for the King&quot;.  The event even took precedence over the World Cup. <a href="/47/news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/5062534.stm">More on BBC News</a><br /><br /> The reason I say it is incomprehensible to us is that we have never known an enduring personal symbol of our country.  Seeing the incredible love, dedication and almost religious devotion to the King, it makes us realize how important his role is for national unity and stability.  He is, to an astounding degree, the symbol of Thai success, morality and stability.  It makes us wonder what it would be like to have American royalty.  Would the country be so divided?  Would the American equivalent of the Thai King be a positive influence, or a joke? </p><br class="clear" />
