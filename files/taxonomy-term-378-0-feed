 <description>&lt;p&gt;Before moving on to India, I just wanted to share some of the images from Malaysia...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the view from the Petronas Twin Towers Sky Bridge.&amp;nbsp; We had to get up early to wait in line for tickets and come back 3 hours later in order to spend 10 minutes on the bridge.&amp;nbsp; It was free, but I&#039;m not sure it was worth the investment in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;199&quot; onload=&quot;show_notes_initially()&quot; src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/53/114619127_8287d0c13c.jpg?v=0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s the view from the ground.&amp;nbsp; Really beautiful buildings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; onload=&quot;show_notes_initially()&quot; src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/42/114513217_fe853c3b17.jpg?v=0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We stayed in Chinatown, on Petaling Street (below).&amp;nbsp; It&#039;s a bit like Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas with more smell, bootleg versions of everything imaginable and foods that looked a bit suspicious. The best food we found was the outdoor restaurant/street food place with the pink tablecloths, where the waiter guys wear sports jerseys.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; onload=&quot;show_notes_initially()&quot; src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/37/114513582_928958de2f.jpg?v=0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;In a somewhat regrettable move, we went to the Genting Highlands, which is &amp;quot;Malaysia&#039;s answer to Las Vegas&amp;quot;, set in the cool mountains outside KL, about 5000 feet up.&amp;nbsp; It was impressively big and the competition to get to a gambling table was fierce.&amp;nbsp; We didn&#039;t.&amp;nbsp; We did find, however, that casinos there don&#039;t like open toed shoes- so I had to buy some socks. This is the Hotel First World...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; onload=&quot;show_notes_initially()&quot; src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/54/114513811_5c35b512d7.jpg?v=0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; KFC and Pizza Hut are EVERYWHERE and usually packed with people. We steer clear.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; onload=&quot;show_notes_initially()&quot; src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/55/114513950_c5fdd0fb07.jpg?v=0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The highlight was meeting Marcus and Andrea from Germany.&amp;nbsp; This couple had been traveling for 2 years and we met them the night before they were going back to Germany. Their advice and company were priceless and their route was opposite ours, so they had been where we are going.&amp;nbsp; So cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; onload=&quot;show_notes_initially()&quot; src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/49/114514129_cfc2879afa.jpg?v=0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;clear&quot; /&gt;</description>

 <title>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</title>
 <link>http://theworldisnotflat.com/dispatch/2006/03/17/kuala-lumpur-malaysia</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re zig-zagging our way across the Indian Ocean, thanks to favorable air fares.&amp;nbsp; From Sri Lanka, we went back to Singapore and took a cheap bus to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where we&#039;ve been for a few days.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;KL&amp;quot; as everyone calls it is OK, but not my favorite place.&amp;nbsp; The food has been awesome and it&#039;s super cheap, but it&#039;s a huge city with less character than I imagined.&amp;nbsp; The next time in Malaysia, we&#039;ll do the non-city tour for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;We&#039;re staying in China Town at a place called the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chinatowninn.com/&quot;&gt;Hotel Chinatown Inn&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; which is perfect for us - recommended.&amp;nbsp; $28US per night, perfect central location, AC, etc.&amp;nbsp; They have late check out too, which we need badly today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a Formula One race starting tomorrow that I wish we could see, but we&#039;re heading to Mumbai India tonight, which should be an amazing experience.&amp;nbsp; India is considered to be one of the hardest places to travel, so I think we&#039;ll be challenged a bit- but it will be really interesting and we&#039;re both excited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly yesterday, both of our ATM cards stopped working and we spent this morning trying to reach Bank of America to get it all set.&amp;nbsp; It&#039;s funny how hard things can be sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope to have the Treo working again to be able to do some moble blogging from India, which I miss greatly.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;clear&quot; /&gt;</description>
