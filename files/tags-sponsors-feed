 <title>TraveI Insurance - World Nomads</title>
 <link>http://theworldisnotflat.com/insurance</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In doing research for the trip, we quickly&lt;span id=&quot;lblAdDisplay&quot; /&gt; learned&lt;span id=&quot;lblAdDisplay&quot; /&gt; that travel insurance&lt;span id=&quot;lblAdDisplay&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldnomads.com.au/index.aspx?affiliate=wrldflt&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;http://www.worldnomads.com.au/files/advertisements/125x125_surfboards.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is recommended and decided &lt;span id=&quot;lblAdDisplay&quot; /&gt;that it would be a necessary cost.&amp;nbsp; Luckily we got hooked up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldnomads.com/index.aspx?affiliate=wrldflt&quot;&gt;World Nomads&lt;/a&gt;, which is a provider of travel insurance for organizations like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lonelyplanet.com&quot;&gt;Lonely Planet&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; We were a bit skeptical at first but liked their converage and really felt good about the way they communicate- it means a lot to us.&amp;nbsp; Here is an example of how they describe their coverage:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;If you are wildlife-watching in the extremes of Alaska and are attacked by a polar bear, are you covered? It depends. You see, if the bear attacks you while you were watching them as a part of a wildlife safari or trekking, then YES we would cover you (assuming the bear didn&#039;t catch you of course), but if you were chasing the bear having had a beer too many the night before and you thought it would be a laugh, er, then NO we wouldn&#039;t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re happy to have World Nomads as a TwinF sponsor for our travel insurance and, judging from our experience so far, we recommend them to others. We should also disclose that we are also a World Nomads affiliate, meaning that if we point potential customers to World Nomads, we can make a small commission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;clear&quot; /&gt;</description>
