      <h2><a href="/journal/2005/09/13/motion-bands" title="Motion Bands">Motion Bands</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: sachilefever on September 13, 2005 - 3:33pm</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>Ever since I can remember, car-sickness has been a handicap for me as a passenger -&nbsp; especially on longer road trips. It has even caused me to drive myself on group road trips, just to avoid the constant headache &amp; nausea and long recovery time once the car stopped. </p> <p>I was definitely concerned about it for our TWINF trip with the expected hot and stuffy chicken buses, roller coaster taxi rides, and possibly rickety trains. Until...we found Motion Bands at REI that we had heard &quot;worked for some people&quot; via pressure points on the inside of your wrists.&nbsp; Acupressure was never something to which I paid much attention, but I thought - why not try it? Feeling like a zombie on Dramamine seemed to be the best option up until now.<br /> </p> We took it for the test on the 2.5 hour ride out to the Olympic peninsula and then up and down windy forest roads in the national park. Besides a very slight and dull headache, there was not a pinch of nausea the entire weekend! I never thought it would be possible, but I'm actually one of the &quot;some people&quot;! Motion Bands just moved to my Must-Have packing list.<br class="clear" />

  <p>Someone recently said &quot;Wow, you're really going to have to start detaching soon.&quot;&nbsp; At the time, it didn't mean a lot, but since it's been on my mind a lot.&nbsp; Preparing for a trip like this really rearranges the way you look at the world and you realize that you really leave your life behind.</p><p>It may sound materialistic, but one of the first things we've detached from is the acquisition of stuff. Everything we buy right now is for the trip and everything else must have some compelling reason for us to get it.</p><p>One of our mottos lately has been &quot;maybe in 2007&quot; because when we see things we like such as, clothes, gadgets, furniture, even new hobbies or major projects, it all goes in the &quot;Maybe in 2007&quot; bucket.&nbsp; 2007 seems so far away.&nbsp; It woud be interesting to see what we want now and compare it to what we want when we get back.&nbsp; I sure those buckets would be very different.<br /> </p><p>&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="content">

  <p>It's time for <a href="http://www.rei.com/">REI's</a> Labor Day sale and you know that that means?  Time to look at getting prepared for the trip.  It's 15 weeks from our departure day of December 11th, so we gotta get some things checked off the list.</p><p>Of course, with <a href="/node/137">the monetorium</a> in full swing, we need to take advantage of the sale.  We're looking at stuff like:</p><p>* Shoes and Sandals</p><p>* Backpacks<br /><br />* Pack Towels</p><p>* Light and quick-drying Clothes</p><p>* First Aid Supplies</p><p>* Insect Repellent</p><p>* Rain Jacket</p><p>* Containers for things like pills</p><p>*Stuff Sacks</p><p>... and all sorts of small miscellany.  It's funny to me to think about how much these things will get used.  I mean, so much of what we bring is going to be with us on a day-to-day basis.  We've considered getting extras of some things and sending a care package to ourselves at soe point.</p><p>Lastly I want to thank the folks that have been contributing, it's so awesome to hear furst-hand perspectives on places like <a href="/node/189">Laos</a> and <a href="/node/192">Cambodia</a>, especially from old friends.  I'm talkin to you JJ and Casey- you guys are doing exactly what we need!</p><p></p><br class="clear" />

  <p>We've been making plans to get certified for Scuba here in the Seattle area before the trip.  It's turned into a big scheduling nightmare as we've had to reschedule like 4 times.  We originally hoped to do it in the bright and sunny days of this month, but now it looks like it'll be October.</p><p>We'll do 2 days of open water classes in the Puget Sound, where the water temperature is about 48 degrees.  brrrrrr.  I'm pretty stoked about the whole thing, but Sachiko...not so much. She's interested, but has a little trepidation about the whole thing.  I do too, to be honest.</p><p>I'm hoping we'll both get certified and be able to see the underwater world on the trip too.  If not, it won't be a huge deal- snorkeling is fun too.</p><p></p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on August 18, 2005 - 3:31pm</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>Well, more big news on the planning front- our date of departure has been set.  Just recently, we were planning to start the trip by driving across the country.  You see, we need to get to North Carolina for the holidays and driving seemed like a good way to start the trip. But, rental cars would cost close to $1000 for the time we'd like to take, not counting gas and lodging.</p><p>At the same time, I had been wanting to go to New York on the way over to see some clients and visit the city.  So, we looked into it and found tickets direct from Seattle to New York City for $120pp one way on Song Airlines.  You can't beat getting across the country for that.</p><p><b>So, final plans are made and our departure date for the trip will be December 11th.</b>  We'll go to New York until the 14th and then catch a train down to North Carolina, where we'll borrow a family vehicle (hopefully) and visit friends in the south for a while before Christman.</p><p>Then, we leave NC on the 30th for Hawaii thorugh New Years- and then the trip REALLY begins on January 6th.  Damn thats a lot of planning- but its so fun!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

We were faced with a choice- a campervan with a toilet/shower or one without.  The difference in cost was about $1000 over a month, which is significant.</p><p>During our own research, we figured that we'd get one without a toilet to save money. Then, we talked to a travel agent who was able to get us a deal thanks to bulk buying power.  The deal we got made our estimates work (close enough) to go with the toileted version.  So, we've got that going for us for about $155 a day or $4300 for 28 days.</p><br class="clear" />

<p>Today we went to the much heralded and lauded <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/travmed/">University of Washington Travel Clinic</a>.  It deserves it's reputation.</p><p>In undertaking a trip like this, I don't think I'd want to do it without visiting something like the travel clinic.  You tell them where you're going and they give you all the information and vaccines and prescriptions you need.<br /><br />We both had 4 shots today: Tetanus-Diptheria, Polio, Typhoid and Hepatitus A and B. We got the run-down on malaria and a bunch of other bugs like Rabies and Japanese Encephalitis. Scary stuff.</p><br class="clear" />
