Lee regrets not brushing teeth after pre-bed Oreo snack.  Shower and finish packing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 6:35am - Walk to free (or included) breakfast.  Yoghurt, pineapple,  meusli, toast for Lee; rice and pineapple for Sachi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 6:50am - Pay final bill at checkout.  An extra night plus 2 lunches and a couple of minibar indiscretions = about US$100.  Karon Beach Resort was a bit of a splurge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 6:55am - Go outside assuming we would see taxis or car-like tuk-tuks.  None are found, feel at-risk for missing flight.  Go back to hotel reception, she calls their driver- he cannot come for 20 mins- not enough time (he says) to make our flight.  Bell boy takes off on motorcycle to track down taxi (earns nice tip).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  7:03am - Aging Alpha Romeo taxi appears.  We climb in and find that we could have saved money by using the hotel minivan.  Feel regret for not accepting the hotel&amp;#39;s offer yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  7:52am - Arrive at airport, check in, buy Rough Guide to SE Asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 8:25am - Board bus to plane and wait for 20 minutes on stationary bus.  Travel approximately 150 meters to plane.  Laugh with other passengers about the ridiculously short bus trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 8:50am - Board plane to Bangkok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 10:28am - Arrive Bagkok, recheck in for Air Asia flight to Chiang Mai.  Find infinite amusement is witnessing a women scurry rapidly from her family to ensure a place in line in front of us- for a flight leaving in 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 11:22am - while waiting for flight, try to connect to airport wireless internet. Costs US$7 per hour.  No way - too much.  Domestic terminal lunch options are:  Burger King, Smoking Pub, Black Canyon Coffee and Dairy Queen. We have Whoppers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1:05pm - Discover that flight is delayed 1 hour.  Meet Sonja, who just graduated high school and has lived in Chang Mai for 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2:10pm - Board flight to Chang Mai on low-cost Air Asia (US$38PP).  Feel pressure to compete for unassigned seats. Share our row with Sonja, who is 1/2 Iranian and 1/2 white American and has lived in Atlanta, Swaziland, Cambodia and Thailand.  Really cool to talk to Sonja. She recommends the Amora Hotel and even has a business card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 3:55pm Arrive at aging but nice Amora hotel, reserve 5 nights for about US$40 per night, breakfast included.. Great location. Relax and plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 5:05pm - Walk blindly into Chiang Mai streets, quickly discover a neighborhood full of uninteresting house fixtures.  Find better street, eat at Noi&amp;#39;s Kitchen, buy book on Pol Pot.  Return to hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 6:09pm - Lee is awed to see this text scroll across the TV screen on BBC World News:  &amp;quot;Microsoft blogger who made the software giant more human is leaving to join a technology startup&amp;quot;.  Scoble made the BBC World ticker? Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 7:12pm - Sachi dissects our toiletries bag and finds 31 miniature toothpaste bottles from Japanese hotels (pictured above).  We realize a great travel tip: If you have more than one of something, use it up completely before opening the next. Otherwise you carry mutiples forever (like both of Lee&amp;#39;s half-full mini shaving cream bottles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 8:05pm - Head out to the THC Rooftop Bar, cool hippy atomsphere and uncool unhippy staff- no smiles at all.  Have dinner for 3 dollars (panang curry beef, oyster sauce beef and pineapple shake).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 9:55pm - Return to hotel to settle in watching US play Czechs in world cup, feeling good about Chaing Mai.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 11:59pm - Feel disappointment for USA&amp;#39;s poor showing.  Sad to see so much ball possession, so little goal scoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;clear&quot; /&gt;</description>

 <title>Back to the Beach in Thailand</title>
 <link>http://theworldisnotflat.com/dispatch/2006/06/06/back-to-the-beach-in-thailand</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I think we overdosed on the Internet access in Japan, as we always had a connection in our room.&amp;nbsp; I could revert to my habitual surfing.&amp;nbsp; Once we landed in Thailand, I had an Internet hangover and I haven&amp;#39;t shared pictures in a while, so this is a chance to catch up a bit.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s rather strange to return to a place like Thailand or Phuket.&amp;nbsp; My camera doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be drawn to the same things.&amp;nbsp; The world is not uniquely new to me, like it is for the first visit. Nevertheless, it is still a wonderful place to be.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;We spent a few days in Bangkok, at our old home at the Asia Hotel. If anyone wants to see some Thai quirk, go there any night for dinner (MRT Stop: Ratchatewi).&amp;nbsp; The Elvis impersonator is there nightly and is fun to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/73/162139249_c65ca03199.jpg?v=0&quot; onload=&quot;show_notes_initially();&quot; class=&quot;reflect&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;You can see from the sweat the he&amp;#39;s working hard.&amp;nbsp; Speaking of sweat, the traffic police must have the hottest job in Bangkok, complete with face mask:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/77/162139914_5050da1710.jpg?v=0&quot; onload=&quot;show_notes_initially();&quot; class=&quot;reflect&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Even the dogs can hardly stay awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/77/162139665_ca18261e23.jpg?v=0&quot; onload=&quot;show_notes_initially();&quot; class=&quot;reflect&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Next was Phuket, where we met Kris and Robert (and tried to get certified for diving). We went to a Thai boxing match with them and here is Robert with &amp;quot;the champ&amp;quot;, who is actually only there for pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/58/162138937_c2966f80b1.jpg?v=0&quot; onload=&quot;show_notes_initially();&quot; class=&quot;reflect&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Phuket doesn&amp;#39;t really do it for us, we decided to replace the days that I would have been learning to dive with a few days on Phi Phi Island (Known for beautiful scenery, the movie &amp;quot;The Beach&amp;quot; and tsunami devastation).&amp;nbsp; Kris and Robert are hopefully going to come meet us here after Kris is certified.&amp;nbsp; We really hope they do, as Phi Phi is another world compared to Phuket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/61/162140749_528eb85129.jpg?v=0&quot; onload=&quot;show_notes_initially();&quot; class=&quot;reflect&quot; height=&quot;163&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Being a secluded island, we thought Phi Phi might be too expensive, too crowded and not what we want, but we&amp;#39;ve found it to be very cool and a good value.&amp;nbsp; It has the laid-back island vibe and it is an amazingly beautiful place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/75/162140393_a8317a753c.jpg?v=0&quot; onload=&quot;show_notes_initially();&quot; class=&quot;reflect&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;I plan to write more about the tsunami&amp;#39;s effect on Phi Phi soon.&amp;nbsp; It really seems that the island has fully recovered.&amp;nbsp; In fact, this little guy makes me wonder if tiny aliens have not invaded recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/49/162140586_028b927696.jpg?v=0&quot; onload=&quot;show_notes_initially();&quot; class=&quot;reflect&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;clear&quot; /&gt;</description>

We&amp;#39;ve moved on to Railay Beach now and it&amp;#39;s great, but we miss Baan Krating already. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;clear&quot; /&gt;</description>

 <title>Songkran&#039;s Day (Thai New Year) in Thailand</title>
 <link>http://theworldisnotflat.com/dispatch/2006/04/13/songkrans-day-thai-new-year-in-thailand</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Our friend Tanya Mau, who has spent a lot of time in Thailand, contacted us recently in email and said this &amp;quot;YOU MUST TRY AND VISIT THE SONGKRAN FESTIVAL (water festival for the Thai New Year) this week.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; So we were sure to heed her advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, we struck out on the scooter yesterday not knowing what to expect.&amp;nbsp; Within about 2 minutes of leaving the resort, we were both completely soaked, head to toe, including the scooter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/50/128242830_e7e1327797.jpg?v=0&quot; onload=&quot;show_notes_initially()&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.1_Songkran%E2%80%99s_Day&quot;&gt;Songkran Day&lt;/a&gt; is the Thai New Years celebration that has roots in using water as a symbol of cleansing for the new year.&amp;nbsp; From our prespective, Songkran is the National Water Fight Day.&amp;nbsp; All along every road, there are people waiting with huge tubs of water, ready to drench anyone who comes by. This makes the normal 40kph road a wet, splashing and noisy parking lot that is more like a party than a road. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/55/128241279_a3d1f89d48.jpg?v=0&quot; onload=&quot;show_notes_initially()&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;It makes for an incredibly fun day and a chance to interact with the locals who love nothing more than to drench a Farang (white foreigner).&amp;nbsp; Some approaching vehicles would see us and rally the troops to cries of &amp;quot;FARANG! FARANG! FARANG!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; We were targets, willingly. Everyone, young, old, male, female, got into the action and no one was spared.&amp;nbsp; All in good clean fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/53/128241201_f60841ecca.jpg?v=0&quot; onload=&quot;show_notes_initially()&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Of course, we had our own defense...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/48/128241338_a23d68eaa1.jpg?v=0&quot; onload=&quot;show_notes_initially()&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;And I sprang to action when the time came...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/48/128241528_e11809586f.jpg?v=0&quot; onload=&quot;show_notes_initially()&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;But found that we were slightly over-powered...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/56/128241606_e4e84c9ee1.jpg?v=0&quot; onload=&quot;show_notes_initially()&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got to hand it to some of the Songkran innovators, who get giant blocks of ice and put them into the water barrels, making ice cold water that is a startling surprise.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;#39;re both thankful to have been a part of the celebration- and that we have a Pentax Option WP- a waterproof camera- without which these pictures would not be possible. &lt;br class=&quot;clear&quot; /&gt;</description>
