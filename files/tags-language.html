    <p class="MsoNormal">Like nearly traveler, we struggle with language &ndash; and sometimes even English.<span>&nbsp; </span>Case in point:<span>&nbsp; </span>Before coming to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> we picked up a Vietnamese phrasebook in a book exchange and began learning some of the basics.<span>&nbsp; </span>The first thing I noticed was a stark difference in the one Vietnamese word I knew: &ldquo;Pho&rdquo;.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pho is a food- a noodle and meat soup that is served all over <st1:city><st1:place>Seattle</st1:place></st1:city>, where you learn quickly that it is pronounced &ldquo;fu<b>h</b>&rdquo;, as in fun.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Upon consulting the phrasebook, we found a very different version of the word about which we felt so confident.<span>&nbsp; </span>The book said it should be pronounced &ldquo;fu<b>r</b>&rdquo;, which to us sounded like the hair on an animal. &ldquo;Fur&rdquo; did not sound Vietnamese at all.<span>&nbsp; </span>The same was true with the word for thank you &ndash; the book said it is pronounced &quot;ga&rsquo;am e<b>r</b>n&quot;.<span>&nbsp; </span>Again, that &ldquo;r&rdquo; sound did not sound right.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Then the light went on in our head.<span>&nbsp; </span>The phrasebook&rsquo;s pronunciation was based on British English &ndash; the real English and not our American version.<span>&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Fur&rdquo; was not fur at all, but a much more sophisticated sounding &ldquo;fuh&rdquo;, where the &ldquo;r&rdquo; is dropped.<span>&nbsp; </span>I could suddenly imagine a British person holding a cup of tea with their pinky finger held out and saying &ldquo;I would nevah weah a fuh coat- that&rsquo;s simply cruel!&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>&hellip;and it all became very clear. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">And in the end, we must recognize that we hold our version of English very dear and we Americans have to realize that our English is not the only, or even the real version of the language.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is a reason it is called &ldquo;English&rdquo;.</p>  <br class="clear" />

  <p>I always have to spell my last name when making reservations anywhere.&nbsp; Even the French automatically spell it the traditionally correct way&nbsp; - LeFevre.

  <p>Lee is 6&#39;3&quot; (190cm) tall and doesn&#39;t always seem to physically fit in Japan. Bus seats never have enough legroom. So many clothing shop clerks look at him and cross their arms in an &quot;X&quot; as if to say &quot;Our clothes are too small for you!&quot; Tonight the hotel attendant ran to find Lee larger house slippers because none would fit him. </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-145033620_f9fb193249.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>He even tries his best to take up as little space as he can on the trains to avoid being the big American with big arm movements - we&#39;ve noticed even the tiniest of school girls only open their small books half a page wide to read on the trains.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-145033201_e731217644.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>We visited a 350 year old temple/house in Kanazawa that was secretly built with 3 stories on the outside, but 7 &quot;layers&quot; on the inside. It is affectionately named &quot;Ninja-dera&quot; (Ninja Temple) because of the self-locking trap doors, see-through stairways and 27 hidden staircases.&nbsp;</p><p>Lee has been proud of not accidently punching an elbow through any fragile shoji doors, and being careful to watch low doorway beams over the last few weeks.&nbsp; However, that day he took a step back. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We were not allowed to take any photos, but the 350 year old beams provided many obstacles in small rooms as we followed the 8 person tour group through the floors. There was one room set under a stairway made of wooden slats and white paper so any intruders would easily be seen and subsequently find their legs slashed from under the stairs. The ceiling was maybe as high as his shoulder, but everyone else fit just fine standing in the room. He stood on the last step just outside of the ceiling beam peering into the room over everyone - a giant among the Japanese - grinning and waiting for end of the description in Japanese. Our calm and professional tour guide smiled along with the knowing chuckles of the Japanese in the group and kept her tour moving. </p><p>&nbsp;The next set of stairs leading to a room with 5 exits and secret stairways caught Lee by surprise. THUD! He whacked his forehead on the beam and grimaced &quot;I almost made it all the way through the house!&quot;. Our tour guide couldn&#39;t help but giggle.</p><p>It&#39;s obvious that Japan&#39;s chairs, ceilings, clothes, vehicles etc. were not made for Lee but he&#39;s enjoying it all anyway, if only from afar or at least just outside peering in... </p><br class="clear" />

Still, there a lots of tiny differences in NZ English that serve to amuse more than confuse us yanks. Most are from British English and some may be regional or innacurate.  Here are some of the terms we've noticed...<br /><br /> <br /><br /> A game room is a &quot;games room&quot;<br /><br /> You don't watch sports, you watch &quot;sport&quot;.<br /><br /> Food or drink you take with you is &quot;take away&quot;<br /><br /> French fries are &quot;chips&quot;<br /><br /> In the car, you don't yield, you &quot;give way&quot;<br /><br /> College is &quot;varsity&quot; not to be confused with &quot;Uni&quot; in Australia<br /><br /> A freeway is a &quot;motorway&quot;<br /><br /> A parking lot is a &quot;car park&quot;<br /><br /> An overpass is an &quot;overbridge&quot;<br /><br /> To fill something up is to &quot;top up&quot;<br /><br /> Instead of buckle, you &quot;do up&quot; your seatbelt<br /><br /> An Americano espresso is a &quot;long black&quot; and a latte without foam is a &quot;flat white&quot;<br /><br /> A cell phone is a &quot;mobile&quot;<br /><br /> An expiration date is an &quot;expiry&quot; date<br /><br /> Low fat 2 percent milk is &quot;trim&quot;<br /><br /> Speed bumps are &quot;judder bars&quot;<br /><br /> Shopping carts are &quot;trolleys&quot; (in some cases)<br /><br /> Appetizers are &quot;entrees&quot; on many menus.<br /><br /> Dates are in the form of dd/mm/yyyy<br /><br /> Cookies are &quot;biscuits&quot;<br /><br /> A fee is a &quot;tariff&quot;<br /><br /> Windsheilds on a car are &quot;windscreens&quot;<br /><br /> Slot or gambling machines are &quot;pokies&quot;<br /><br /> You don't rent, you &quot;hire&quot;<br /><br /> Sunny weather is referred to as &quot;fine&quot;<br /><br /> A cash register is a &quot;till&quot;<br /><br /> When something is small it is &quot;wee&quot;<br /><br /> Driving under the influence is &quot;drink driving&quot;.<br /><br /> A round trip ticket is a &quot;return&quot; ticket<br /><br /> Bell Peppers are &quot;capsicums&quot;<br /><br /> A cooler or ice chest is a &quot;chilly bin&quot;<br /><br /> The letter Z is pronounced &quot;Zed&quot;.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> If you ask me, some of these terms make a lot more sense than the US versions.  An appetizer should be called &quot;entree&quot;, right? </p><br class="clear" />

  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the first things I learned a while back, being a white guy from the mainland in Hawaii, was that I am a &quot;Haole&quot;, which generally means white foreigner. Some might even say I'm a &quot;dumb haole&quot;.&nbsp; As in &quot;Look at that dumb haole try to surf&quot;.</p><p>&nbsp;(I just told Sachi I'm writing about being a dumb haole and she begs to differ and says I'm not a dumb haole)</p><p>Anyway, one of the cardinal rules of being a haole is to not try to sound Hawaiian or speak <a target="_self" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Pidgin">pidgin</a>.&nbsp; The basic idea is that it is very obvious when we try and only serves to make us look foolish. So, you won't hear me say that something was so good that it &quot;broke a mout&quot;, or is &quot;da grinds brah&quot;. I'm not sure I can pull it off.<br /> </p><p>Apparently there is even a very nuanced way to throw the shaka sign (thumb and pinky out).&nbsp; We haoles should proceed with caution when using this hand signal as it, again, can be a sure fire way to express our haoleness.</p> <p>Of course though, all this being said, I've had nothing but a good time with locals.&nbsp; They love to have a good time and love to live the aloha lifestyle. How can blame them.<br /> <br /> We took a little walk today near Sachi's house, on a beach called &quot;Kahala Beach&quot;...<img width="500" height="375" src="/files/includes/images/33-59261122_f4bb15a65f.jpg-v-0.jpg" alt="" onload="show_notes_initially()" /> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />
