    <div class="info">By: leelefever on May 3, 2006 - 5:41pm</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p><a href="http://gen.kanai.net/">Gen Kanai</a> is a Japanese New Yorker who has been living in Tokyo for about 3 years.&nbsp; In fact, he grew up within a couple of blocks from the Murray Hill neighborhood where we stayed in <a href="/47/dispatch/2005/12/13/on-location-new-york">New York in December.</a></p><p>Anyway, Gen and I know some of the same folks and when plans were made to visit Tokyo, we made plans to meet Gen there.&nbsp; Last night we went out to a very nice and tasty tempura restaurant called Ginza Tenkuni, which has been around since 1885. More on the food in a minute.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-140015832_905e34086b.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>What excited me was learning about the Japanese gadgetry.&nbsp; First, we met at the Apple store in the Ginza district and used their computers to find a restaurant.&nbsp; Then, Gen put the restaurant&#39;s phone number into his GPS-enabled phone.&nbsp; From that point, the phone guided us to the restaurant with voice commands as we walked through Ginza.&nbsp; In Japanese, the voice from the phone would say &quot;In 50 meters, turn right&quot;. I was very impressed.&nbsp; Also, did you know that the Japanese don&#39;t use SMS (short message/chat)?&nbsp; They use email for mobile text communications. This is the mobile GPS system...</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/45-140015866_968861c313.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Once we got to the restaurant, it was obvious that we had entered a very fine and traditional tempura house, which is a bit like a high class sushi bar, but only serving seafood and vegetables fried in a light batter. The quality of food was equalled by the japanese service and ambience that could be described as beautiful. The experience was quite a treat.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-140015899_c126c5d6bb.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>One of the dishes I had never had was the fried shrimp legs.&nbsp; They were better than they sound- further proving my point that frying anything makes it better. :)&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/54-140015934_45f83ccf6e.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;We owe a big thanks to Gen for his hospitality.&nbsp;  </p><br class="clear" />

<p class="flickr-yourcomment">
	Folks, in what is true to our style of travel, we've arrived in Southern Thailand with no specific plans.  The problem is an overwhelming number of options.<br /><br />
So, we figure this might be a good time to call on you, dear TwinF readers.  We're hoping that you can help us figure out locations and accomodations for the next couple of weeks. We're trying to find a place to take a vacation from travel- we need a place to relax and do very little.<br /><br />
You can help by Adding a New Travel Experience to this site, leaving a comment on this entry or emailing us using the Contact Us tab above.<br /><br />
If you're a blogger, it would be an interesting experiment if you could point your readers to this entry to see if the blog world has input.<br /><br />
What are your favorite places in Southern Thailand?

	When I told people about being able to update the TwinF site using the Treo Smartphone, I always said the same thing...<br /><br />
"If I'm looking at the Reclining Buddha in Bangkok and want people to see what I see in real time, I can take a picture and post it directly to the site."<br /><br />
Well, here we are, and here it is- the giant Reclining Buddha in Bangkok. What you can't see is the sweat dripping out of my every pore, which as u know, Sachi loves.

Unfortunately their methods do more to repel business than attract it for people like me. The touts are a lot like email spam, or as Sachi says, pop-up windows. We call it &quot;sidewalk spam&quot;.<br /><b> First</b>, they are selling something you don&#39;t want or need and never asked for.<br /><b> Second</b>, their message is indescriminate -we often hear offers to shine our shoes, which are usually sandals.<br /> <b>Third</b>, they will not take &quot;no&quot; or &quot;nahin&quot; for an answer, ever.<br /> <b>Fourth</b>, they are inexhaustable. Behind each tout is a line waiting (or not) for their turn.<br /> <b>Fifth</b>, they do not speak English very well.<br /> <b>Sixth</b>, the majority have hidden agendas and their only goal is to extract a maximum amount of money, even through dishonest means.<br /> <b>Seventh</b>, responding in any way only encourages them. Showing a bit of interest causes a feeding frenzy.<br /> <b>Eighth</b>, they interfere with the messages you want to hear. Well meaning individuals are often lost in the melee.<br /> <b>Ninth</b>, it is a numbers game. Their MO seems to be tenacity and bombardment. Sending the message repetitively to 1000s of people is how to get one to bite.<br /><b> Tenth and finally</b>, they are learning quickly. Recently I saw two interesting products from the touts <br /> - Foreign newspapers including USA Today<br /> - SD memory cards<br /> <br /> This is a vast improvement over faux wood carved elephants, postcards and bracelets.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, like email spam, the ignorant and naive folks make the sidewalk spam business model work. So, the message here is to do your part to fight sidewalk spam - ignore it completely and hope that it goes away. </p><br class="clear" />

Some examples:<br /> Animals will constantly appear in the road, including Brahma bulls, dogs, goats, camels, water buffalo, boars. Elephants and monkeys. Hitting a bull or cow in India kills the driver ends game play.<br /> Since there are no sidewalks, people will constantly appear in the road and show little respect for a vehicle. Again, skillful use of the horn will ensure safe navigation through masses of pilgrams, farm workers, beggars and pedestrians.<br /> The other vehicles on the road represent the most dangerous objects. Freight trucks, buses, rickshaws, motorcycles and bicycles appear constanly. The driver will have to contend with sudden stops, constant passing, vehicles going the wrong way on a one way street, aggressive merging and general unpredictability. Full concentration is required.<br /> The road itself will change often. Large potholes, unmarked speed bumps, construction areas, sudden detours, and one way bridges are to be expected and navigated skillfully.<br /> In some cases, the driver may have to make stops for the passengers to be sick, eat or take pictures. The driver may make extra money by picking extra passengers, but this reduces the tip amount. Answering stupid questions is optional.<br /> Ultimately, it is a game of speed and survival in a place where rules of the road do not apply. It is every driver for himself and the one who finds the most creative and death defying way to safely deliver his passenger(s) to their destination wins and advances.<br /> As an experienced driver in India once put it, &quot;To be able to drive in India, you need 3 things: Good brake, good horn and good luck&quot;.<br /> <br /> This game could be applied to several other destinations around the world. </p><br class="clear" />

Please excuse the jargon and acronyms.<br /><br />A big part of our trip is experimenting with mobile phones in each country. Specifically, we want to be able to post to the TwinF site using our Treo 650 Smartphone. When we arrive in a new country we get a new SIM card and a prepay account, which gives us a local phone number and a non-roaming connection to the local network.<br /><br />It&#39;s likely no surprise that the world, what we&#39;ve seen anyway, is mobile crazy. Surely one of the most pervasive products in any village is prepaid recharge cards. We&#39;ve found that coverage is generally strong and there are multiple networks in nearly every location, including the high country of Sri Lanka. Below are our experiences in India and Sri Lanka.<br /><br /><b>Sri Lanka:</b><br /><br />Sri Lanka has GSM and CDMA is apparently &quot;coming soon&quot;. The major networks are Mobitel and Dialog GSM on the bands of 900/1800 &amp; 850/1900. Both GPRS and MMS are available. To get started with a new SIM card and 400 rupees of prepaid service costs about $20US. We could not get the Treo 650 to connect to GPRS, though it is supposed to be possible. If you have problems, you must go to a phone store in either Colombo or Kandy. My advice is to make sure you get the GPRS settings when you get the SIM card. It was frustrating and time consuming to try to get GPRS settings to work in Sri Lanka.<br /><br /><b>India:</b><br /><br />India is pretty advanced with mobile technology. They have both GSM and CDMA and the networks support both MMS and GPRS using the bands of 900/1800 &amp; 850/1900. The major networks are Hutch and Airtel, with Airtel being the first and biggest. It costs about $15US to get started with a new SIM card and prepaid minutes. India has some of the cheapest phone rates in the world with calls costing less than $.02US per minute.<br /><br />In India, note that if you travel across state lines, you may not recharge (top up) your prepay account with a voucher from a store- you must visit a phone store. This was the case with the Hutch Network. Also, I had to visit a Hutch store in order to get GPRS set up properly.<br /><br />SMS is very popular in both India and Sri Lanka- and is the cheapest way to communciate. By providing our mobile number to the airline, we get flight status updates via SMS for free. One of the drawbacks of it is what I would call SMS spam from the networks who constantly send offers for new services and plans.<br /><br />Anyone with an unlocked GSM phone should have no problem using a prepaid account in Sri Lanka or India. </p><br class="clear" />

Yay!<br /> <br /> Second, we were happy to catch Amos on the Skype video cam.  To be in Mumbai India and see and hear live video of our dog so easily is almost unbelievable.  We do miss that dog.<br /><br /> Third, I am a huge nerd. </p><br class="clear" />

Crikey!<br /><br /> Notice that laptop battery is low and there's no time to charge.<br /><br /> Put pen drive in pocket for use in Internet Cafe, sans blog post.<br /><br /> Must make mobile phone (Treo 650) work in Australia - look up closest Vodafone store to buy pre paid SIM card.<br /><br /> Find store, get $10 SIM card, load with $30 of credit and register credit card for easy refills.<br /><br /> Call ahead to make tonights hotel res amid worries of effects of big rugby match.<br /><br /> Feel relief that phone works and hotel near stadium has room.<br /><br />  Test email via Treo.  Bugger! Cannot connect - data plan (GPRS) costs extra and cust service is closed today.<br /><br /> Feel tinge of pain from not being able to blog/upload pics easily using Treo.<br /><br /> Note that SMS will work with pictures and test the network by writing an entry called &quot;Tech Battles in Intl Mobile Blogging&quot; to be posted to TwinF via Flickr using SMS.<br /><br /> Hope that messaging will do the trick.<br /><br /> Live to fight another day - and note to charge laptop at next stop.</p><p class="flickr-yourcomment"><b>Updated:</b>&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; The multimedia SMS or MMS (what Vodafone calls PXT) worked for blogging.&nbsp; I can post to TwinF from my mobile using MMS&nbsp;which posts to Flickr (photo and entry), which posts to this site.&nbsp; How cool.&nbsp; The only thing cooler right now is that our hotel has FREE WIFI.&nbsp; We were the hands-down victors in this battle.<br /></p><p class="flickr-yourcomment">&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />

This is the inaugural TwinF tech report.<br /><br /> I cannot get over how pervasive the cell phone signal is in NZ. It is quite literally everywhere and MUCH better than the US, even to coverage within the Seattle city limits.<br /><br /> Having network access all the time means that our investment in a prepaid SIM card has paid off ($35NZ to get started).  By getting a NZ SIM card, we basically use the network the same as the locals.   We are using Vodafone.<br /><br /> Calls are .49 NZ<br /><br /> Text Messages .20 NZ<br /><br /> Web/Email by the kb<br /><br /> We have been very happy with how the Treo 650 has performed for mobile email and web access. A couple of tricks  I&#39;ve learned to save $ when browsing the web... disable images (a big help) and hit &#39;stop&#39; before the page loads completely. I find that letting it get to about 25kb is enough.<br /><br />  Speaking of the Treo... The combination of a 2gb SD card and music player pTunes has made the Treo into a great little MP3 player.  The external speaker does the job quite well for hanging out in the campervan.<br /><br /> Here is our blogging process...<br /><br /> We take a lot of pictures and load them onto the laptop.  Then, we write a post and save it onto the laptop.  We then plug a pen drive into the laptop and move the post and pictures onto the pen drive so all we have to take to a cafe is the pen drive.  We sit down and immediately start uploading pictures to Flickr since it takes about 10 mins for 6 photos.  Once uploaded, we copy in the entry add the pictures and we&#39;re done.<br /><br /> Of course most of the blogging can be done just like this post - by sending a picture and entry to Flickr via email using the Treo, which then posts it to the site.  If we wanted, we  could easily blog many times a day with the Treo.  Sometimes though, we want to share more and better pics. </p><br class="clear" />
