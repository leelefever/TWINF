    <div class="content">

  <p class="MsoNormal">I return from 3 days of learning about elephant training more of an elephant lover and with more mixed feelings about the life of the domestic elephant.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The <a href="http://www.changthai.com/">Thai Elephant Conservation Center</a> offers a <a href="http://www.changthai.com/webchang/activities.php">multi-day mahout training course</a> that enables a tourist to live at the center for 3 days to learn about elephants and elephant training, their relationship with their trainer (the mahout) and general elephant/mahout life.<span>&nbsp; </span>The course includes accommodation for 2 nights, 5 meals and all instruction for about $125.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Below is one day in the mahout training program.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/61-172558478_01799726fc.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /><o:p> <br /></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><st1:time minute="0" hour="6">6am</st1:time>:</b> Awake from our basic bungalow style houses and don our very flattering mahout uniforms- blue denim pants that tie at the waist and a button-down shirt.<span>&nbsp; </span>I remark that I look like a prisoner.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><st1:time minute="30" hour="6">6:30am</st1:time>:</b> Me, Yuri (from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>) and Kristine (from <st1:place><st1:city>San Jose</st1:city>, <st1:state>California</st1:state></st1:place>) follow the mahouts in pouring rain over a mile into the forest to collect the elephants that had been kept their overnight.<span>&nbsp; One of the mahouts finds this wicked looking scarab beetle.&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/47-172559261_fa82dd8bf2.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /><o:p> <br /></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><st1:time minute="0" hour="7">7:00am</st1:time>:</b> The mahout &ldquo;Tit&rdquo; and I reach Lu Khan, my elephant for 3 days.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 50 feet of chain that kept her in place overnight is stretched to the full length and she shows excitement as we approach. much of the vegetation surrounding her is either flattened or eaten.<span>&nbsp; </span>Lu Khan is covered with dirt that she threw onto herself overnight to cool down and keep the flies away.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tit has Lu Khan lay down with the command &ldquo;map long&rdquo; and he uses his machete to scrape away the dirt and unchains her from the tree.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/61-172559862_5a3c01b7ed.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><st1:time minute="10" hour="7">7:10am</st1:time>:</b><span>&nbsp; </span>I mount Lu Khan for the trip home.<span>&nbsp; </span>During the trek she willfully veers off course to grab some greenery just off the trail.<span>&nbsp; </span>She is graceful in the mud, taking every step carefully and never slipping down hills.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think that she is the best all-terrain vehicle ever.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/49-172558187_eab08c69ce.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="333" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><st1:time minute="30" hour="7">7:30am</st1:time>:</b> Between the jungle and the <st1:place><st1:placename>Conservation</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>, we wade through a river for one of her 3 baths of the day.<span>&nbsp; </span>She completely submerges herself as the mahout and I scrub the remaining dirt off her hide.<span>&nbsp; </span>I get completely soaked.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s easy to tell she loves the water.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/51-172560288_89b8aaff92.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><st1:time minute="50" hour="7">7:50am</st1:time>:</b> We arrive at the center and Lu Khan gets fresh water and sugar cane while we scrub her even more.<span>&nbsp;

enables me to slide off the front of her head.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s obvious that my commands don&rsquo;t matter- she only really listens to Tit, her mahout for the last 9 years.<span>&nbsp; </span>After practice she eats bananas and more sugar cane with me on her neck along with dried bananas.<span>&nbsp; </span>As soon as I get the package of dried bananas, her trunk appears in front of me, begging for some and breathing elephant breath on my face.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mmm elephant breath.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/70-172559184_4ebf23210f.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30am</st1:time>:</b> All the elephants and mahouts (including us students) meet near the back of the center for more eating. <span>&nbsp;</span>The elephants steal food out of one another&rsquo;s mouths with no protest.

I&rsquo;m not quite so comfortable. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><st1:time minute="45" hour="9">9:45am</st1:time>:</b> A crowd of spectators gathers near the river beside the center and we ride the elephants into the river for bath #2.<span>&nbsp; </span>This one is mostly for the crowd, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter to Lu Khan.<span>&nbsp; </span>I get soaked again as I do my best to throw more water to clean her hide.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some elephants spray each other and the mahouts are pre-occupied with a snake that has been sighted on the other side of the river. We appear in many pictures.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/49-172558381_bdb2d02ff3.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10am</st1:time>:</b><span>&nbsp; </span>The elephants and mahouts ride through the crowd to the show grounds where they show the crowd a few tricks, how they move logs and some cheesy things like painting and playing music.<span>&nbsp; </span>The next day I will be part of the show, but not today.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><st1:time minute="45" hour="10">10:45am</st1:time>:</b><span>&nbsp; </span>The show ends and I mount Lu Khan while she eats more.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then more practice.<span>&nbsp; </span>The elephants are chained by the foot near food if they are not currently involved with the mahout.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><st1:time minute="0" hour="12">12:00</st1:time></b> Eat Lunch- Home cooked fried rice.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00pm</st1:time>:</b><span>&nbsp; </span>We walk to the elephant hospital with an English speaking guide.<span>&nbsp; </span>I am grateful to have access to him as Tit knows little English and I had many questions.<span>&nbsp; </span>The hospital has about 10 elephants.<span>&nbsp; </span>3 with deformities, one with a gunshot wound, a couple in &ldquo;poor condition&rdquo;.<span>&nbsp; </span>The biggest problem for elephants is constipation, which can easily kill them.<span>&nbsp; </span>Judging from the amount of pooh they create, this is not surprising.

    <div class="content">

  <p>Being that we&#39;re leaving from Tokyo, we decided to come back to experience three specific things that we didn&#39;t get to do on our first visit to the city.&nbsp;</p><p>First, is what are called the cos-play-zoku, or costume play gang, that gather in Harajuku&#39;s Jingu-bashi in outlandish costumes.&nbsp; They like having the attention for the most part, but you get the feeling that they aren&#39;t doing it to impress the tourists that photograph them.&nbsp; They stick together and take lots of photos of one another too.&nbsp; A weird and fun experience that we recommend highly.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/52-154654144_212f0b7d3f.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;I didn&#39;t smell anything bad.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/73-154654077_5b411ce819.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;You rarely see any young Japanese person without a mobile phone, even if they are wearing a little bo peep outfit.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/77-154653989_f9eb2740fa.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;This is just plain scary and reminds me of Bangkok.<br /></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-154653921_0d2cc9d3bc.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>Next on the list was seeing the Shibuya crosswalk on a busy day. It is the busiest crosswalk in the world.&nbsp; Amazing.</p><p>&nbsp;This is before:<br /></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/64-155424645_9fe7038848.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;and after:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/70-155424719_d996d06f62.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Lastly, it would appear that I have some bizzare fascination with rush hour trains.&nbsp; I would say that it is an interest in the daily lives of people in other countries.&nbsp; Like in <a href="/dispatch/2006/03/20/the-sport-of-rush-hour-train-boarding-in-mumbai-india">Mumbai, India,</a> I made a special point to got to the Tokyo train station at rush hour.&nbsp; Actually, I got up early to ride a packed train this morning just to see what it was like.</p><p>Once I got on, I was amazed at the absolute silence and how the volume of people meant that no one had to hold on. I was against the door and the girl next to me had her should in my back for the whole ride.&nbsp; I only rode for two stops and felt good that I didn&#39;t have to be in the middle of all the people.&nbsp; Here&#39;s a shot from inside that doesn&#39;t do it justice:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/75-155428771_e83294c4f4.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;These guys man some of the busiest stops on the line and they physically push people into the cars before the doors close. I didn&#39;t get to see it myself, unfortunately.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/62-155434231_4b8e8c681e.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;And so, we&#39;re coming to a close of the Japan-based blogging, which is greatly enhanced by high speed internet connections in Japanese hotel rooms.&nbsp; We&#39;re off to Bangkok in the morning and I imagine we&#39;ll write a little more about Japan before it&#39;s all over. </p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="content">

  <p>TwinF readers know that we&#39;re a bit cynical about the tourist experience and look for the authentic things that make a place unique or different.&nbsp; It only takes a few seconds on the streets of Tokyo, Osaka or Kyoto (or even in small towns) to feel that Japan is a very different place. Here are some of the things we&#39;ve seen (or haven&#39;t seen):</p><p>Something that has bugged me is that there are very few trash cans in public places (compared to home). I sometimes carry trash around for 10 minutes looking for a proper receptical.&nbsp; The Japanese are very particular about their trash and I think it&#39;s a good thing.&nbsp; However, it does mean that some instruction is required.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/49-151189209_e2572cd15b.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;In every city there are buildings filled with tiny bars.&nbsp; There are hundreds of them and one night we decided to check out a few.&nbsp; Walking into one of these tiny bars is like walking into someone&#39;s living room and running one of their friends off the couch.&nbsp; We were not welcome and it was obvious.&nbsp; Signs like this display the bars by name:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-152406072_1d506be677.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;Another ubiquitous part of walking around is the prevalance of platic food.&nbsp; The Japanese have mastered the art of creating plastic versions of the dishes served within a restaurant.&nbsp; I rely on them and remain astonished at how good plastic food can look- and it never spoils! </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/49-151189292_5e02f6cb2b.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;The Japanese have also made life easier for blind folks by providing a raised strip of sidewalk that leads to public transport, toilets, etc.&nbsp; Not really remarkable, but truly ubiquitous.&nbsp; They are everywhere.</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/54-153630909_0eeae86079.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /></p><p>&nbsp;In Japan, you might see gas pumps that hang from the ceiling:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-144325773_cfa1b070be.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Or cantaloupes that cost&nbsp; US$46.00.&nbsp; This is an example of &quot;omiyage&quot;, which is a present that someone brings back to friends after traveling.&nbsp; Thanks to omiyage, the Japanese take gift shops to a whole new level.&nbsp; It is the most perfect cantaloupe I&#39;ve ever seen. </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/50-146114809_38f4438a71.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Or these contraptions, which must be some sort of bench.&nbsp; I cannot find a comfortable way to sit in one.&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;m too big.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/51-141088399_350882c148.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>In Japan, you might even see hotels (often called Love Hotels) that display their rates as such.&nbsp; Love Hotels are (supposed to be) used for couples who cannot get privacy at home, thanks to granny and the kids. </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/45-153631286_f284c93b5c.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;My brother Randy went to Japan and one of his points was that every square inch of land is utililized for something productive.&nbsp; He was right.&nbsp; Outside of the cities you don&#39;t see yards beside houses.&nbsp; Instead, you see rice paddies, which are much more productive than plain old grass.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/46-149763102_e24bca387d.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>The vending machines in Japan could be a whole other post.&nbsp; Pocari Sweat is a bit like Gatorade and became one of my favorites.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/50-153654519_18e658f849.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;I heard about beer in vending machines so much, but we rarely saw any.&nbsp; We figure a law must have changed.&nbsp; Though, at one hotel we had vending machines for beer, whiskey and sake.&nbsp; I like this quote from punk band The Ramones: &quot;We came across a miracle, there was beer in the soda machine&quot;.&nbsp; Some of the best and cheapest food comes from places where you pay a vending machine outside and take a ticket inside to be served.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-155421258_5cd2c673ac.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" />&nbsp; <br /></p><p>In Japan, a constant source of hilarity is what some call &quot;<a href="http://www.engrish.com/">engrish</a>&quot;, or English translated from Japanese that comes out a bit, um, off.&nbsp; A perfect example.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/48-148641777_1a8db3f726.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;In Japan, you&#39;ll see heaps of young Japanese women struggling to walk with torturous high-heeled footwear.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure if they don&#39;t know how to walk in heels or if their shoes are not meant for walking, but I truly feel sorry for them. Sometimes they fall down.<br /></p><p>We&#39;re just hours from leaving at time of writing and I will miss Japan.&nbsp; Quirky, beautiful, tasty, fun, Japan has it all.&nbsp; I&#39;ll be back.&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on May 28, 2006 - 2:38am</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>With Osaka as our base we took a few days and went to two of the major cultural centers of Japan: Kyoto and Nara. </p><p>The first capital of Japan was in Nara and Kyoto was the home of the emperial family for much of its history. This all makes for too many sites to count.&nbsp; That&#39;s why I feel sorry that our time in this area is going to have to be condensed in one post.&nbsp; We are leaving Japan soon and while we have an Internet connection, we hoping to get a few posts up in the last day or two. </p><p> Kyoto is only about 30-40 minutes for Osaka by express train.&nbsp; However, this fact is misleading because it doesn&#39;t account for getting to the main station in Osaka or to the desired station in Kyoto.&nbsp; All said and done, it took about 1.5 hours each way, which was a bit of a grind.</p><p> Though it rained and rained, Kyoto was amazing.&nbsp; We&#39;re not huge fans of shrines and temples, but the gardens that accompany them are incredible , once you get outside of the Kyoto concrete jungle. </p><p>Ginkaku-Ji, which is a stop on the philosopher&#39;s path, was my overall favorite.&nbsp; Small, but intricate and very well kept. </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-152406028_055322e0f0.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Despite seeing many temples and shrines in Japan, this was the first&nbsp; time I had seen the zen gardens with carefully and almost unbelievable constructed sand structures.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/73-154686908_db5469b16e.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Next was Heian Temple in Kyoto, or more specifically, the gardens at Heian, which you might recognize from the movie Lost in Translation:&nbsp;</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/56-151946281_28b143f897.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/63-154686866_64e802b243.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>One of the real highlights for me was seeing a couple of real geishas in the Gion district of Kyoto.&nbsp; I deliberated for a while and finally asked this one for a picture (in Japanese no less!) </p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/44-152406093_da7d399f87.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /></p><p>Nara is an easy day trip from Osaka and most of the sights are all in the same park. Nara has the largest wooden structure in the world: the Daibutsu Den Hall, rebuilt last in 1709.&nbsp; The size of the building is quite deceptive. It&#39;s <strike>big</strike> freaking HUGE in every porportion. Awesome.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/65-153630993_27bd1ce7c8.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Inside is a giant wooden buddha (nearly 500 tons of bronze) and two very cool (and scary looking) wooden statues.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-153630932_dfec4ba2af.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>The park in Nara is covered in friendly Deer, who are considered national treasures and sometimes terrify food-carrying kids. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/78-154676111_9e7052e60a.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>And this completes the whirlwind tour of the Kansai region.&nbsp; Phew. <br /></p><br class="clear" />

  <p>The area around Osaka, which includes Kobe, Nara and Kyoto, is the cultural center of Japan and where we based ourselves for 5 days.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>We used Osaka as a base and stayed at the <a href="http://www.hotel-riva.com/">Hotel Riva Nankai</a> in the Minami area, which was an excellent location (like Osaka&#39;s Times Square), but priced a bit more than we wanted at about US$120 per night.&nbsp; Luckily, there was a mix-up and we had to change rooms and they gave us a better room for about US$85.&nbsp; Woo-hoo!</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/60-154686847_6ba7a3e9c9.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>So we kicked around Osaka some.&nbsp; The aquarium was pretty amazing as it has the largest single indoor tank in the world which contains a whale shark- the world&#39;s largest species of fish.<br /></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/33-151934772_7d02f2df06.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;I really dug the jellyfish.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/49-151934819_1b482d7242.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Osaka is a bit grungier than the other cities we visited.&nbsp; The fashoin is a little more urban and people are generally more boisterous.&nbsp; This made for the best people watching in Japan.&nbsp; All the rage in Osaka were knee-high black stockings and brightly colored heels:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-151935826_4c9cea695e.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /> </p><p>All the guys have bleached hair worn a bit like the &quot;hair bands&quot; in the 1980s.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/64-153631347_2fad10ca05.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;We also saw a baseball game: the Osaka Buffaloes against Yokohama.&nbsp; First of all... buffaloes?&nbsp; They couldn&#39;t find anything more Japanese than that?&nbsp; The game on the field was just like any American baseball game, but the crowd was a different story.&nbsp; Each team had live marching bands in the outfield bleachers that made the most noise as their team&#39;s batter was at the plate.&nbsp; Everyone was seated, even during a homerun, when they beat inflatable bat-things together furiously.&nbsp; At one point, everyone blew up balllons and let them go at once.&nbsp; Apparently we didn&#39;t get the memo, but it made for a cool spectacle.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/47-154681506_2109e462fb.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Then of course, the Japanese have invented innovative ways to dispense beer (that is a small keg on her back and a tap&nbsp; in her hand).&nbsp; This photo also provides further proof that it is impossible for Japanese girls to be in front of a camera without a &quot;peace sign&quot;.<img src="/files/includes/images/24-153631109_728bee92f9.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>To cap it all off, we had a roto (conveyer belt) sushi joint behind our hotel, where we went twice to enlarge our stomachs.&nbsp; The sushi just keeps coming.</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/67-154686799_9ad9eac54d.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /></p><br class="clear" />

  <p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m genetically inclined to remember all the names of these Japanese towns.&nbsp; They all have four syllables and seems to all begin or end in yama (which makes sense as &quot;yama&quot; means mountains and we&#39;re in the Japanese Alps).&nbsp; No matter though, what I will remember is the beauty of these places.</p><p>Unfortunately, Mother Nature has not been kind of late. In the past week we&#39;ve seen the sun on one day.&nbsp; Other than that, it has been rather dreary with occasional rain. On the other hand, it has been abour 65(f) degrees- which is simply luxurious compared to SE Asia.</p><p>&nbsp;We talked about some of these places, but didn&#39;t get to provide many pictures, so here is a load of pictures from the last week or so...Oh, and a big thanks to TwinF member (and long-time friend) Kai for <a href="/47/blog/kaibrown/old-japan">pointing us in the right direction</a>. </p><p>My favorite small town so far has been Tsuwano, where we stayed in the <a href="/47/ryokan">ryokan</a>. Here&#39;s the town from above:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/48-145033754_d5e3e210cd.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;The view above is from a hike we did up the Tsuwano Castle ruins- from about 1500AD.&nbsp; </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/51-145033772_853d4d35ff.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="111" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Here&#39;s Sachi on the ruins:</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/53-145033670_620737cfaf.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="500" width="375" /></p><p>&nbsp;I got to ride in this little bike thing called an Anttcycle.&nbsp; It&#39;s pedal powered with a little extra juice from solar power.&nbsp; Very cool, but I need an XL.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/52-145033582_10e853a847.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Tsuwano has a ton of these types of scenes too.&nbsp; I keep trying to find a picture that captures, to me at least, the essence of traditional Japanese style.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-145033388_3916aeb197.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;We&#39;re on trains a lot and it&#39;s fun and quite entertaining.&nbsp; Not once has a train been more than one minute late.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/50-145033227_438aba9df9.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Some of the trains have been around a while.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-148641549_e666adb606.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Sachi&#39;s not sad, just tired.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-146115053_ac2485d462.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Kanazawa was next.&nbsp; We really liked Kanazawa- it was very kind to tourists with good maps everywhere and a great overall experience- you can tell they are trying to become a tourist destination. The city has the most amazing train station exterior I&#39;ve seen. OK, maybe there were two days of sun. </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-146794722_52d90457b4.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Kanazawa&#39;s main attraction is Kenrokuen Gardens.&nbsp; It may have been that we don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; Japanese gardens. This one is nice and it may have been a bad time of year, but we were a little let down. The Kenrokuen Garden is rated as a top-3 garden in Japan.&nbsp; Still nice, but not what we expected.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/46-148654187_b7cf3a292c.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="138" width="500" /></p><p><i>&nbsp;Updated:</i>&nbsp; I wanted to say a little more about the Japanese gardens. I&#39;d say that we do &quot;get&quot; most gardens, but the Kenrokuen was different than we expected.&nbsp; It is known as the &quot;Garden of Six Attributes&quot;, which are: seclusion, antiquity, spaciousness, human ingenuity, water and scenic views.&nbsp; The one attribute that seems to get in the way for us is human ingenuity.&nbsp; All over Kenrokuen, trees are being propped up by braces- so much so that you can&#39;t appreciate the trees for the braces in the way:</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/51-148985683_084e0b98f4.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="500" width="375" /></p><p>The bracing is an ancient practice and is particularly useful in Kanazawa where it snows heavily.&nbsp; However, from my western and amateur perspective, the bracing is obtrusive and takes away too much of the natural beauty of the scenery and trees. But that&#39;s just me. </p><br class="clear" />
