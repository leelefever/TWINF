Lee regrets not brushing teeth after pre-bed Oreo snack.  Shower and finish packing.<br /><br /> 6:35am - Walk to free (or included) breakfast.  Yoghurt, pineapple,  meusli, toast for Lee; rice and pineapple for Sachi.<br /><br /> 6:50am - Pay final bill at checkout.  An extra night plus 2 lunches and a couple of minibar indiscretions = about US$100.  Karon Beach Resort was a bit of a splurge.<br /><br /> 6:55am - Go outside assuming we would see taxis or car-like tuk-tuks.  None are found, feel at-risk for missing flight.  Go back to hotel reception, she calls their driver- he cannot come for 20 mins- not enough time (he says) to make our flight.  Bell boy takes off on motorcycle to track down taxi (earns nice tip).<br /><br />  7:03am - Aging Alpha Romeo taxi appears.  We climb in and find that we could have saved money by using the hotel minivan.  Feel regret for not accepting the hotel&#39;s offer yesterday.<br /><br />  7:52am - Arrive at airport, check in, buy Rough Guide to SE Asia.<br /><br /> 8:25am - Board bus to plane and wait for 20 minutes on stationary bus.  Travel approximately 150 meters to plane.  Laugh with other passengers about the ridiculously short bus trip.<br /><br /> 8:50am - Board plane to Bangkok.<br /><br /> 10:28am - Arrive Bagkok, recheck in for Air Asia flight to Chiang Mai.  Find infinite amusement is witnessing a women scurry rapidly from her family to ensure a place in line in front of us- for a flight leaving in 2 hours.<br /><br /> 11:22am - while waiting for flight, try to connect to airport wireless internet. Costs US$7 per hour.  No way - too much.  Domestic terminal lunch options are:  Burger King, Smoking Pub, Black Canyon Coffee and Dairy Queen. We have Whoppers.<br /><br /> 1:05pm - Discover that flight is delayed 1 hour.  Meet Sonja, who just graduated high school and has lived in Chang Mai for 5 years.<br /><br /> 2:10pm - Board flight to Chang Mai on low-cost Air Asia (US$38PP).  Feel pressure to compete for unassigned seats. Share our row with Sonja, who is 1/2 Iranian and 1/2 white American and has lived in Atlanta, Swaziland, Cambodia and Thailand.  Really cool to talk to Sonja. She recommends the Amora Hotel and even has a business card.<br /><br /> 3:55pm Arrive at aging but nice Amora hotel, reserve 5 nights for about US$40 per night, breakfast included.. Great location. Relax and plan.<br /><br /> 5:05pm - Walk blindly into Chiang Mai streets, quickly discover a neighborhood full of uninteresting house fixtures.  Find better street, eat at Noi&#39;s Kitchen, buy book on Pol Pot.  Return to hotel.<br /><br /> 6:09pm - Lee is awed to see this text scroll across the TV screen on BBC World News:  &quot;Microsoft blogger who made the software giant more human is leaving to join a technology startup&quot;.  Scoble made the BBC World ticker? Wow.<br /><br /> 7:12pm - Sachi dissects our toiletries bag and finds 31 miniature toothpaste bottles from Japanese hotels (pictured above).  We realize a great travel tip: If you have more than one of something, use it up completely before opening the next. Otherwise you carry mutiples forever (like both of Lee&#39;s half-full mini shaving cream bottles).<br /><br /> 8:05pm - Head out to the THC Rooftop Bar, cool hippy atomsphere and uncool unhippy staff- no smiles at all.  Have dinner for 3 dollars (panang curry beef, oyster sauce beef and pineapple shake).<br /><br /> 9:55pm - Return to hotel to settle in watching US play Czechs in world cup, feeling good about Chaing Mai.<br /><br /> 11:59pm - Feel disappointment for USA&#39;s poor showing.  Sad to see so much ball possession, so little goal scoring. </p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="content">

  <br /><p class="MsoNormal">Like many travelers, we understood that <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> would be an expensive place in which to travel.<span>&nbsp; </span>After spending a month in the country, we&rsquo;d like to provide our perspectives on how much travel costs for tourists in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp; </span>All prices are in American dollars.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">In visiting any country as a tourist there are 5 costs that must be considered:<span>&nbsp; </span></p>    <ol style="margin-top: 0in" start="1" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal">Arrival      - The cost of getting there (and leaving) </li><li class="MsoNormal">In-Country      Transportation- The cost of moving around within the country</li><li class="MsoNormal">Lodging-      The cost of having a place to sleep each night</li><li class="MsoNormal">Food      and Alcohol- Keeping the belly full</li><li class="MsoNormal">Tourist      Activities- Seeing and Doing</li></ol>    <p class="MsoNormal">Unfortunately, the first 3 of the 5 costs for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> are likely the highest you&rsquo;ll pay in almost any country- but there are some ways around the high expense.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <ol style="margin-top: 0in" start="1" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal"><b>Arrival</b> &ndash; It is generally      expensive to fly into <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>      from anywhere in the world.<span>&nbsp;      </span>However, there are places in the world that serve as major hubs and      you may find that departing from these hubs can reduce the costs. We      bought a round trip ticket from <st1:city><st1:place>Bangkok</st1:place></st1:city>      to <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city> for about $650 per      person, even during <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>&rsquo;s      holiday season (Golden Week- April 25<sup>th</sup>- May 5<sup>th</sup>).<span>&nbsp; </span>We hadn&rsquo;t seen any tickets under $1,000      other than the ones we purchased.<span>&nbsp; </span>The      best advice is to plan ahead, be prepared and jump on any tickets that are      below your expectations.</li></ol>    <ol style="margin-top: 0in" start="2" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal"><b>In-Country Transportation</b> - This      one is an absolute no-brainer.<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>      has an amazingly safe, efficient and comfortable rail system that serves      almost the whole country.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you      plan to travel to more than one or two cities it is essential that you      purchase a &ldquo;<st1:place><st1:placename>Japan</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Rail</st1:placename>       <st1:placetype>Pass</st1:placetype></st1:place>&rdquo; or &ldquo;JR Pass&rdquo;.<span>&nbsp; </span>You must get the JR Pass before you      leave - you CANNOT get one in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.      The JR Pass web site has listings for ticket agents worldwide.<span>&nbsp; </span>We bought a standard 14 day pass for      $391 per person.<span>&nbsp; </span>That seems like a      lot, but once you start seeing how much inter-city train travel costs,      you&rsquo;ll be glad you have the pass.<span>&nbsp;      </span>For instance, a one way trip from <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city>      to <st1:city><st1:place>Kyoto</st1:place></st1:city> on the Shinkansen      bullet train costs about $200 per person.<span>&nbsp;      </span>We figure that our JR Pass paid for itself within the first week of      our trip.<span>&nbsp; </span>Taxis are rather costly      too and we took them very rarely.<span>&nbsp;      </span>In <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city>, the charges      start at about $5 and can quickly rise to over $50 on a late night trip      home (subways stop around <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>).      Further, most major cities have subways (not covered by the JR Pass) that      cost $1-$3 point-to-point</li></ol>    <ol style="margin-top: 0in" start="3" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal"><b>Lodging</b> &ndash; Tourist lodging in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>      can be a complex mix of western rooms vs. Japanese style rooms, regular      hotels vs. business hotels, ryokans vs. hotels and hostels.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hostels offer the lowest rates ($20-50      per person) and the high end reaches to thousands of dollars.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the whole, staying in hotels in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>      is an expensive affair, with 2-3 star western-style rooms costing $70 per      night or more for two people. Often there are different prices for the      number of people, enabling a single traveler to find a cheaper room.<span>&nbsp; </span>For $80-$120 you get the regular hotel      amenities (TV, A/C, bathroom, tea, breakfast, etc.) along with some      Japanese treats like a yukata (robe), slippers, a shoe horn, disposable      toothbrush, etc.&nbsp; Near most train stations are &ldquo;business hotels&rdquo; which lack character, but have convenient locations, basic amenities (plus in-room Internet connection) and a decent price.<span>&nbsp; </span>We found business hotels to be useful and easy for our travels in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> and usually paid between $60-$80 per night.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you want the Japanese experience of staying in a <a href="/47/ryokan">ryokan</a> (traditional Japanese traveller&rsquo;s lodge), we suggest going to a nice one and paying the $200 for the whole experience.   </li></ol>  <ol style="margin-top: 0in" start="4" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal"><b>Food and Alcohol</b> - Aside from the      basics listed above there are other costs that should be considered.<span>&nbsp; </span>Food, of course, tops the list.<span>&nbsp; </span>Food is one thing in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>      that offers a number of choices for different travelers.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is possible to eat street-side      noodles or a rice bowl meal for less than $4 dollars and then walk around      the corner to a tempura restaurant that is $100 per person. Like many      things in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>,      you pay for the experience.<span>&nbsp; </span>Also,      as a <a href="/47/blog/truthchild/eats-under-5-and-with-no-japanese">TwinF member mentioned</a>, there are great choices in the convenience      stores, like 7-11, which have delectable sushi rolls for about $2.<span>&nbsp; </span>We found nearly all food, cheap or      expensiv,e to be delicious, fresh and of high quality.<span>&nbsp; </span>Also, you will surely drink your weight      in Japanese tea, which is generally served free of charge.&nbsp; The Japanese must consume more beer per capita than any other country.<span>&nbsp; </span>Beer is sold everywhere and the prices are quite reasonable, depending on your drinking habits. A can of beer is usually about $2 from a vending machine and a draft beer in a restaurant is about $3-4.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sake is also very popular and the prices vary widely based on reputation and quality, like wine.</li></ol>        <ol style="margin-top: 0in" start="5" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal"><b>Tourist Activities</b> - One of the      wonderful things about <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>      is that by simply being there, your tourist ambitions are fulfilled.<span>&nbsp; </span>Walking the streets, riding the trains      and sitting in parks all offer the tourist a view into the quirky and      entertaining culture &ndash; free of charge.<span>&nbsp;      </span>You will pay for entrance into castles, some temples and shrines,      etc.<span>&nbsp; </span>These are usually between      $5-10 per person. On the whole though, tourist activities in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>      are not prohibitively expensive and the most rewarding things are free.</li></ol>    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in"><b>So, to answer the question: Is </b><st1:country-region><st1:place><b>Japan</b></st1:place></st1:country-region><b> Expensive?</b><span>&nbsp; </span>We would say yes.<span>&nbsp; </span>We spent about $200-250 per day, all inclusive. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Compared to a place like Thailand, Japan is 3-4 times more expensive on a day-to-day basis.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, the expense is the cost of admission to experience a truly unique, sophisticated and beautiful country that is extremely safe, clean and very rich in culture.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was well worth our money.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <br class="clear" />
