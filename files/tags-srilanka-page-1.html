      <h2><a href="/dispatch/2006/03/14/the-sight-guides-of-sri-lanka" title="The Sight Guides of Sri Lanka">The Sight Guides of Sri Lanka</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on March 14, 2006 - 6:09am</div>

    <div class="content">

  &nbsp; <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Guides are big business in Sri Lanka. The government&rsquo;s tourist board licenses them and they are useful and interesting part of seeing historical sites such as Anuradhapra and Polonoruwa. With the help of Nimal, we hired quality guides ahead of time and didn't regret it. They are essentially interpreters; describing the historical significance of the sites along with some amusing anecdotes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">&nbsp;Here are our guides for the ancient cities, all of which we enjoyed:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">This is R.P. Chandrasa (cell: 0722-925997) specializes in bicylce tours of Anuradhapura.<br /><img src="/files/includes/images/56-112425527_efe78f1276_m.jpg" /></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Our guide for Polonnurawa:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="/files/includes/images/49-112425528_f37f1231bb_m.jpg" /></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">And our guide for the amazing Sigiriya. This guy spoke 5 languages.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="/files/includes/images/44-112425529_f63a123b6f_m.jpg" /></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">There seem to be two types of guides: hired ones (above)&nbsp;and leeching ones. With the hired ones, the relationship is clear &ndash; for a few dollars, they will be your guide. The leeching ones can be useful, but you should be leery of their agenda.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br /></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">As we saw many times in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kandy, Sri Lanka, the guides will sidle up to you, start a friendly conversation and then start to lead a walk describing every plant. These guides may or may not be certified and their business is to provide a guide service in exchange for a tip to be given at the end of the walk. The problem is that this relationship is not clear in the beginning. It&rsquo;s very easy to assume the guide is a friendly park employee, paid to provide the service. It&rsquo;s not so and a simple &ldquo;no guide please&rdquo; will send the message and they will leave.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br /></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Other &ldquo;guides&rdquo; however have a different agenda. As we approached the entrance to the Tooth Shrine in Kandy, a young and honest looking guy came and said that we should see the &ldquo;free&rdquo; temples before entering the Tooth Temple. He was obviously a leech guide, but we figured we&rsquo;d see what he had to say. He led us around a bit and said that for one particularly interesting-looking temple, we would need to make a small contribution. We entered the temple and on the way out another man approached us about what appeared to be a visitors book. In the book were the names and addresses of travelers from all over the world followed by amount of contribution. Each person had apparently given from $10-20US (a lot for a &ldquo;contribution&rdquo;). I signed my name and told the man that I would not contribute that much. I contributed about $2 and left, much to his chagrin. Upon leaving that area, we tipped the young guide and entered the Tooth Temple.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br /></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Looking back, it was clear what had happened. The young man was not just a leech guide &ndash; he was in cahoots with the contribution guy, ensuring a flow of na&iuml;ve tourists were entering the second-tier and &ldquo;free&rdquo; attraction, where their cash could be efficiently extracted. That book I signed either contained a list of suckers (me included) or it was designed to relate the desired amount of contribution for those unsure. <br /></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Either way, it worked on us and we learned a lesson. I don&rsquo;t think the guide was completely dishonest, but the scheme was designed to prey on people like us, who struggle with not knowing how much to tip or contribute in all the situations where it is appropriate. It&rsquo;s a daily battle and we just want to do what is appropriate, which is often very hard to know.</p><br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/bargainingsrilanka" title="Bargaining is a Learning Process, Kandy, Sri Lanka">Bargaining is a Learning Process, Kandy, Sri Lanka</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: sachilefever on March 8, 2006 - 8:14pm</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>Bargaining is a way of life here, as it is in most of Asia and other parts of the world. We, and most Americans, are just not good at it because we've never really had to do it on a daily basis. Or maybe I should say hourly basis. Everything is up for bargaining -&nbsp;Food, crafts, hotel rooms, tips for the people who store your shoes at the temples. It's a little exhausting just because on top of trying to bargain smarter, we have no notion of how much things should cost. We know they raise the prices for tourists (sometimes even 3 or 10 times the local price), but knowing what we should pay as a tourist is a tricky deal. I think you need a driver to clue you in or just spend enough time in a city or country to get a feel of the markets. </p><p>Lee has been learning to bargain better. I think he did well in Singapore, but we're still getting used to the price conversions here. For the price of a collared dress shirt in the US, you can apparently buy a nice wardrobe for a year here - as a local. After every transaction, Lee just shrugs his shoulders and guesses the price sounds right. We feel much more like tourists than anywhere else so far. We'll figure it out more as we go. </p><br class="clear" />

  <p>Sri Lanka is even more foreign than I&nbsp;imagined.&nbsp; We've hired a driver named Mervin&nbsp;who is driving us arond the island.&nbsp; It's a good thing too because if we had to drive here, or even take the bus, it may&nbsp;be a life threatening experience.&nbsp; The barely two lane roads soemtimes become six lanes, packed with busses, cars, three wheelers and trucks.&nbsp; Is really amazing to watch.</p><p>The people are wonderful - very laid back, friendly and interested in all things western.&nbsp; We are as foreign to some of them as they are to us and it is a weird feeling- almost like celebrity.&nbsp; We have not met a single American here, but there seems to be some Englidh, Dutch and German tourists.&nbsp; The tsunami was a major hit on the local tourist economy, even though the vast majority of sights were untouched.&nbsp; Terrorism has been a worry in the past (before 2001), but things are peaceful now and we feel very safe.</p><p>As you might imagine, Sri Lanka doesn't have a big Internet Cafe culture, so our posting has been a bit lax. But, we're taking lots of pictures that will appear here on the site soon.</p><p>Yesterday I rode an elephant into 6 feet of water&nbsp;and almost had a sandal stolen by a monkey.&nbsp; Today I wore a sarong at&nbsp;a Buddhist temple. Sachi is recovering from a small stomach issue, but is almost at full strength again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />

  <p>As I mentioned earlier, we have arrangements to head to Sri Lanka for about 10 days, starting on the 4th of March. We had no idea we might go, until we talked to an Englishmen that highly recommended it and then did some research.&nbsp; So, we're going.&nbsp; This flexibility thing is nice.</p><p>We've added a new Country Page to the Member Travel Experiences for <a href="/sri-lanka">Sri Lanka</a>. If you've been, or know people that have been, tell us about it. Comments on this entry work too. Thanks!</p><br class="clear" />
