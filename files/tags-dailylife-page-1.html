We fell in love with the city over about 6 days.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The incredible efficiency of <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> was most fascinating to me.<span>&nbsp; </span>Looking around, there are so many things that I hope we&rsquo;ll see in <st1:city><st1:place>Seattle</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The first and coolest is the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/en/index.jsp">Octopus Card</a>&rdquo;, which operates like a debit card and works for all city<img src="/files/includes/images/81-208902896_1b8f57901f_m.jpg" align="right" /> transit, 7-11s, McDonalds,&nbsp; <span></span>drug stores, supermarkets etc.<span>&nbsp; </span>Anywhere you see the little Octopus card reader, you can press your card onto it and money will be deducted from your prepaid account.<span>&nbsp; </span>The first time I used it at a 7-11, the first words out of my mouth were &ldquo;holy sh*t that&#39;s efficient!&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>You don&rsquo;t even have to take the card out of a wallet or purse- just hold it over the reader and the money is zapped out. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Last night over dinner we talked to some locals who showed us their Octopus card which had their picture and information on it.<span>&nbsp; </span>For them, the card is used to open the door of their home and other places that require membership.<span>&nbsp; </span>They said that some schools even use Octopus cards for daily attendance.<span>&nbsp; </span>By their estimates, 90-95% of all <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> people have one and most people love it.<span>&nbsp; </span>For people who are worried about privacy or Big Brother, they can choose to get a card with no personal connection.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, they lose some of the convenience.<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Seattle</st1:place></st1:city> needs this.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">In busy restaurants, the servers have wireless ear pieces that are used for constant communications among the staff.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s invisible to the customer, but the communication makes service seem magical, as if they are almost reading your mind.<span>&nbsp; </span>You walk in the door and each server looks up and guides you along your way as you wind through the restaurant.<span>&nbsp; </span>The teamwork is remarkable.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The public busses are generally double decker.<span>&nbsp; </span>That&rsquo;s all I have to say about that.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I&rsquo;ve never waited so little for the subway.<span>&nbsp; </span>We never waited more than 2 minutes for the next MTR train to arrive and when it did, it would never get too packed with people.<span>&nbsp; </span>Because they run so regularly and often, as a train fills up, people often choose to wait for the next one instead of forcing their way into an already full train. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The world needs more escalators if you ask me.<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> has hot weather and hills- a good recipe for putting escalators to good use. In the hills rising up from the Central area of downtown there are a system of covered escalators called the Mid-Levels, which efficiently shuttle people to and from their hillside high-rise residences and the hip caf&eacute;-culture neighborhood called <st1:place>Soho</st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Mid-Levels system ascends 800 meters up the hill, running downhill in the morning and uphill in the afternoon.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> must be one of the best air conditioned places on earth.<span>&nbsp; </span>We made up a couple of names for our interaction with the cool air:</p>    <ul style="margin-top: 0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal">AC      Poaching &ndash; This is shopping in a store for the single purpose of cooling      down.<span>&nbsp; </span></li><li class="MsoNormal">The <st1:place>Hong       Kong</st1:place> Arctic Wind &ndash; Shops blast cool air onto the sidewalk as      an invitation to come inside for some AC poaching.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the dense retail areas of <st1:city><st1:place>Kowloon</st1:place></st1:city>      the Arctic Wind seemed to lower the overall sidewalk temperature a few      precious degrees.</li></ul>    <p class="MsoNormal"><st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> even seems to have served one of my long standing culinary pet peeves. <span>&nbsp;</span>I have never understood why shrimp are served with the tail attached.<span>&nbsp; </span>You often see a nice grilled or saut&eacute;ed shrimp arrive at your plate with the tail on; obscuring a section of meat and causing the consumer to have to clumsily remove the tail before eating it.<span>&nbsp; </span>So far in <st1:place>Hong  Kong</st1:place>, my shrimps have arrived as whole shrimps, tails removed but hidden meat intact.<span>&nbsp; </span>Again, <st1:place>Hong  Kong</st1:place> makes something more efficient.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place>&rsquo;s efficiency is surely rooted in the money that flows through the city more quickly than almost any city in the world.<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> is quite good at making it easy for people to depart with their money.<span>&nbsp; </span>When it comes in the form of something like the Octopus Card, I&rsquo;m almost happy to see it go.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/78-208901940_2411712078.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/85-211688738_9b94821047.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="142" width="500" /> <br /></p><br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/dispatch/2006/07/27/anatomy-of-a-scam-in-vietnam" title="Anatomy of a Scam in Vietnam">Anatomy of a Scam in Vietnam</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on July 27, 2006 - 8:22am</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>It&rsquo;s been said many times- be clear with a Vietnamese cab driver about your hotel, or they will take you to their friend&rsquo;s hotel, where they will earn a commission.  We&rsquo;ve seen many attempts at such diversions, but none so blatant as we experienced today, just after arriving in Hanoi.  </p><p>We took a cab from the airport into town (37km for US$10). On the way, we told the driver to go to the &ldquo;Camellia 3&rdquo; Hotel and showed him where it was on the map.  He agreed and the agreement was settled.  Along the way he had a number of phone calls, which rang in a ring tone with the volume on 11. We understood nothing he said.  </p><p>Upon arriving in the Old City of Hanoi, a young Vietnamese guy walked over to the car, opened my door, stuck his head into the car about 3 inches from my face and said &ldquo;<i>Welcome to the Camellia 3 Hotel!</i>&rdquo;  I struggled to look around him at the building and the awning and did not see anything about the Camellia, or any hotel for that matter. No matter what we asked, he continued to insist, quite rudely &ldquo;<i>Yes, this is the place, the Camellia 3 Hotel, let me get your bags.</i>&rdquo; All I could say was, &ldquo;<i>First, please back up and let me get out of the car.</i>&rdquo;  I left Sachi in the car and stepped into what was supposed to be the Camellia 3 Hotel.  I walked to the reception desk and said &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;d like a business card please, where is your business card?</i>&rdquo;  Their answer:  &ldquo;<i>We ran out</i>&rdquo;.  This, of course was a lie and there was no longer any doubt what was happening. This was not the Camellia 3 Hotel.  </p><p>The cab driver must have thought we were complete idiots.  He actually thought that he could drop us off at some random hotel and we would believe, thanks to the not-so-skillful scamming of his not-so-sly cronies, that we had arrived at our requested destination and would blindly get a room, earning him a commission.  </p><p>We&rsquo;ve met a lot of nice people in Vietnam, but it is the prevalence of this kind of bullshit that will forever leave a bad taste in my mouth.  We said to him what we say to all people who try to pull such stunts.  &ldquo;<i>You are bad for tourists &ndash; you keep doing this, tourists will stop coming</i>.&rdquo;  He only smiled with a &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t win&rsquo;em all&rdquo; attitude and went off to give another tourist a good reason not to come back to Vietnam. </p><br class="clear" />

  <p>&nbsp;Anyone who has spent more than 15 minutes on the streets of <st1:place>SE  Asia</st1:place> knows the street hawkers &ndash; the people selling goods and services on the street.<span>&nbsp; </span>The most dominant and tenacious of the hawkers are the drivers- people offering rides on their tuk-tuk or motorcycle.<span>&nbsp; </span>Others include people selling sunglasses, drinks or any other tourist consumable.<span>&nbsp; </span>I would guarantee with absolute certainty that the two phrases I&rsquo;ve heard most over the last two months are &ldquo;Sir! Where you go?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sir! You buy something?&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>This morning over breakfast we denied no fewer than 6 offers for the Saigon Times newspaper.  </p>  <p class="MsoNormal">We&rsquo;ve gotten used to it, but sometimes we just want to throw all of our stuff on the ground and pitch a fit in the middle of the street screaming &ldquo;<i>I have had ENOUGH!<span>&nbsp; </span>NO! I DO NOT want a RIDE or a DRINK or a T-SHIRT and if I do, I WILL FIND YOU!!!!</i> Most of the time though we just offer a polite &ldquo;no thanks&rdquo; and walk away.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The situation is not unlike the story we all know of the boy that really, really likes a girl. The girl is not so into him, but politely talks to him and smiles at him politely.<span>&nbsp; </span>The smitten boy of course perceives any interaction as a move in the right direction and pursues the girl with tenacity.<span>&nbsp; </span>He asks her out on a date every time they meet and over time, the girl tires of his advances to the point of becoming annoyed. Little does he know it, but with each interaction he drives her further and further away. Eventually the girl learns that the only way to deal with the boy is to ignore him completely and be leery of other boys like him.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Such is our situation with the street hawkers. With each offer, we find ourselves less and less likely to deal with them or even acknowledge that they exist. Like the smitten boy, they don&rsquo;t realize it, but their tenacity is actually preventing more business than promoting it.</p><p class="MsoNormal">See also:&nbsp; <a href="/47/dispatch/2006/04/02/10-reasons-street-hawkers-are-like-email-spam">10 Reasons Why Street Hawkers are Like Email Spam</a>&nbsp;</p>  <br class="clear" />

    <div class="content">

  <p>After India, even places known for unsanitary conditions seem all the more worry-free.&nbsp; This may have been the case with Laos, which was much nicer than I expected, but lacks infrastructure nonetheless.&nbsp; We jettisoned the hand sanitizing lotion in Thailand/Japan and did not look back. Perhaps we should have as we&#39;ve both been laid low by minor ailments lately.&nbsp; Just a little head cold and some digestive troubles to welcome us to Cambodia.</p><p>I&#39;m hoping Sachi will have some words for you about Laos soon, but in the mean time, I&#39;d like to talk about currency.&nbsp; First of all, I didn&#39;t realize until we were already there that Laos (or the People&#39;s Democratic Republic of Laos) is a communist country with an almost free-market enconomy (a bit like China).&nbsp; Anyway, much like Cambodia, multiple currencies can be used.&nbsp; The Lao &quot;kip&quot; is joined with the US Dollar and the Thai Baht.&nbsp; There are 10,000 kip for each American dollar, making for wallet-bulging stacks of change.&nbsp; </p><p>Officially, the Lao government says that the Kip is the only and required currency.&nbsp; However, Lao Airlines, the government-owned carrier will <i>only</i> accept payment in US dollars.&nbsp; Such is the state of affairs in Laos.</p><p>Here in Cambodia, the defacto currency is the US Dollar ($1 to about 4000r).&nbsp; The Cambodian Riel is often given for change to the dollar, but at a grocery store today I noticed a cash register that looked just as it would at home- stocked with US money.  I used 10 minutes (US$.20) of Internet time today, payed with a one dollar bill and received 8 bills of change back in the Cambodian Riel.&nbsp; Wallet bulging.</p><p>I fulfilled a couple of my trip-long goals today by visiting the Killing Fields and the Tuol Seng Prinson here in Phnom Penh, both big parts of the murderous Khmer Rouge regime in 1975-1979.&nbsp; I&#39;ll have a lot to say about that soon. </p><br class="clear" />

Lee regrets not brushing teeth after pre-bed Oreo snack.  Shower and finish packing.<br /><br /> 6:35am - Walk to free (or included) breakfast.  Yoghurt, pineapple,  meusli, toast for Lee; rice and pineapple for Sachi.<br /><br /> 6:50am - Pay final bill at checkout.  An extra night plus 2 lunches and a couple of minibar indiscretions = about US$100.  Karon Beach Resort was a bit of a splurge.<br /><br /> 6:55am - Go outside assuming we would see taxis or car-like tuk-tuks.  None are found, feel at-risk for missing flight.  Go back to hotel reception, she calls their driver- he cannot come for 20 mins- not enough time (he says) to make our flight.  Bell boy takes off on motorcycle to track down taxi (earns nice tip).<br /><br />  7:03am - Aging Alpha Romeo taxi appears.  We climb in and find that we could have saved money by using the hotel minivan.  Feel regret for not accepting the hotel&#39;s offer yesterday.<br /><br />  7:52am - Arrive at airport, check in, buy Rough Guide to SE Asia.<br /><br /> 8:25am - Board bus to plane and wait for 20 minutes on stationary bus.  Travel approximately 150 meters to plane.  Laugh with other passengers about the ridiculously short bus trip.<br /><br /> 8:50am - Board plane to Bangkok.<br /><br /> 10:28am - Arrive Bagkok, recheck in for Air Asia flight to Chiang Mai.  Find infinite amusement is witnessing a women scurry rapidly from her family to ensure a place in line in front of us- for a flight leaving in 2 hours.<br /><br /> 11:22am - while waiting for flight, try to connect to airport wireless internet. Costs US$7 per hour.  No way - too much.  Domestic terminal lunch options are:  Burger King, Smoking Pub, Black Canyon Coffee and Dairy Queen. We have Whoppers.<br /><br /> 1:05pm - Discover that flight is delayed 1 hour.  Meet Sonja, who just graduated high school and has lived in Chang Mai for 5 years.<br /><br /> 2:10pm - Board flight to Chang Mai on low-cost Air Asia (US$38PP).  Feel pressure to compete for unassigned seats. Share our row with Sonja, who is 1/2 Iranian and 1/2 white American and has lived in Atlanta, Swaziland, Cambodia and Thailand.  Really cool to talk to Sonja. She recommends the Amora Hotel and even has a business card.<br /><br /> 3:55pm Arrive at aging but nice Amora hotel, reserve 5 nights for about US$40 per night, breakfast included.. Great location. Relax and plan.<br /><br /> 5:05pm - Walk blindly into Chiang Mai streets, quickly discover a neighborhood full of uninteresting house fixtures.  Find better street, eat at Noi&#39;s Kitchen, buy book on Pol Pot.  Return to hotel.<br /><br /> 6:09pm - Lee is awed to see this text scroll across the TV screen on BBC World News:  &quot;Microsoft blogger who made the software giant more human is leaving to join a technology startup&quot;.  Scoble made the BBC World ticker? Wow.<br /><br /> 7:12pm - Sachi dissects our toiletries bag and finds 31 miniature toothpaste bottles from Japanese hotels (pictured above).  We realize a great travel tip: If you have more than one of something, use it up completely before opening the next. Otherwise you carry mutiples forever (like both of Lee&#39;s half-full mini shaving cream bottles).<br /><br /> 8:05pm - Head out to the THC Rooftop Bar, cool hippy atomsphere and uncool unhippy staff- no smiles at all.  Have dinner for 3 dollars (panang curry beef, oyster sauce beef and pineapple shake).<br /><br /> 9:55pm - Return to hotel to settle in watching US play Czechs in world cup, feeling good about Chaing Mai.<br /><br /> 11:59pm - Feel disappointment for USA&#39;s poor showing.  Sad to see so much ball possession, so little goal scoring. </p><br class="clear" />

I set out to make the trip more interesting by reading books about the places we plan to visit and to varying degrees I&#39;ve succeeded in that so far.<br /><br /> I started by leaving home with one-third read &quot;Blink&quot; by Malcolm Gladwell. The first international book was chosen in a bookshop in New Zealand on a bit of a whim. I went in considering a book about Capt. James Cook and left with the book &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; by John Man. I read this book aloud to Sachi while in our rented campervan and we both enjoyed it immensely. We knew so little about the legendary man before and now we&#39;re hoping to see the Mongolian steppe (Ghengis&#39; home) later this summer.<br /><br /> Next we bought a couple of smaller books in Australia (not a cheap place to buy books): A Travellers History of Japan and a book of memoirs of survivors of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. Both short and interesting reads, but nothing to write home about. Oops.<br /><br /> Taking a break from non-fiction, I then read Barrel Fever by David Sedaris, who consistently makes me laugh out loud and inspires me to try more satirical writing. Following that was a short book that sparked an interest in me that I didn&#39;t expect: Ben Franklin&#39;s autobiography. Short and frank, I found myself wanting it to be longer or more complete.<br /><br /> A book that was perfect for being in the tsunami-affected region was &quot;Krakatoa&quot;, by Simon Winchester. A truly interesting event in history that I enjoyed learning about very much. Did you know that the shock wave of Krakatoa&#39;s volcanic explosion rippled around the earth 7 times?<br /><br /> Back on the Cambodia tip, I read &quot;The Lost Executioner&quot; by Nic Dunlop, which was about his search the commander of Tuol Sleng, the famous Cambodian death prison during the Khmer Rouge reign. I have a fascination with modern Cambodian history and plan to read a Pol Pot biography soon.<br /><br /> Just tonight I&#39;m celebrating the finish of a book that is sitting unread at home in hardcover form: &quot;Collapse&quot; by Jared Diamond. I read his Pulitzer Prize winning &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot; a while back and said that it made me smarter than any book I&#39;d ever read before - particularly regarding the creation of civilization in the last 10,000 years. Collapse is equally as informative and focused on what has undone civilizations in the past. I would recommend this book for travelers interested in environmental conservation issues. Smart guy that Diamond- I&#39;m a fan.<br /><br /> Just last night I bought &quot;1776- America and Britain at War&quot; by David McCullough. The abrupt and pre-war end of Ben Franklin&#39;s autobiography whetted my appetite I&#39;m sure. Sachi also bought &quot;Under the Banner of Heaven&quot; by John Krakauer, which is about the creepy side of mormonism. I&#39;m sure l&#39;ll read that too.<br /><br /> If anyone is looking at these books and saying &quot;I know some books Lee would like AND would be popular enough to find around world&quot; please do let me know. </p><br class="clear" />
