    <div class="info">By: andrewmoran on July 26, 2006 - 11:41am</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>I see you guys are planning on taking the train from Beijing to Moscow. In October of last year, we took it going the other way, and had a fantastic time. We stopped in Irkutsk, and spent a few days in a tiny town about an hour outside called Listavyanka. It wasn&#39;t touristy, we stayed in a homestay (where the owner of the house puts you up as a guest &amp; feeds you whatever the family are eating) and those few days really stood out as a highlight of a yearlong trip.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As for the train journey itself, I can&#39;t stress enough that you bring a lot of books and instant coffee. And vodka. Do promise that you&#39;ll be careful with the vodka, otherwise, you&#39;ll end up drinking your entire supply for 4 days in one evening, and then there&#39;ll be vomiting, and that just makes everyone uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The cabins come in 2 or 4 berth flavours. We were travelling in a group of 4, and got a cabin to ourselves, but then we made friends with the 2 swedish guys in the next cabin, and they had their 4 berths to themselves for most of the journey, so it&#39;s the luck of the draw, i suppose.&nbsp; </p><br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/blog/tanyamau/southern-thailand" title="Southern Thailand">Southern Thailand</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: tanyamau on June 26, 2006 - 9:40pm</div>

    <div class="content">

  Southern Thailand (Phuket, Andaman Coast, Koh Samui, Koh Phang Nga, Koh Tao): pronounced "Gaw", 'Koh' means 'island'.  

* Skip Koh Samui â Itâs like Bangkok with a beach.  Very dirty and skanky.  See if for a day, and then spend more time on the other islands.
* Koh Tao : Go scubadiving at Buddha View Dive Resort (a PADI 5 star dive resort with really cool instructors and lots of fun, cool, laidback people, many Europeans, best buffet dinner, and fun bar with nearby free movies, nice restaurant out at the end of the walkway)
	- If you catch the speed boat back to Chumporn and then catch the overnight train back up towards Bangkok, thatâs the best economical way to go.  If you have to wait a bit, Chumporn has a cool little restaurant/internet cafÃ©/guesthouse where you can rinse off in the bathroom, get some pizza, and check email before you get a ride back to the train station.  There are also a lot of street stalls and 7-11s around the normal dinner hour.
* Koh Phang Nga: Has the full moon parties (raves).
* If youâre around Phuket/Surat Thani, head towards the jungle to KHAO SOK NATIONAL PARK.  My Seattle friends went and loved the jungle, wildlife, and flora/fauna.  You can stay in treehouse-like bungalows or cheap camping style bungalows.  A nice place (but I know they didnât stay there) is Artâs Riverview Jungle Lodge (phone 0 7739 5009; rooms & bungalows 350 â 550 baht).  Also check out Treetop River Huts (<a href="http://www.treetops-riverhuts.com/" title="www.treetops-riverhuts.com">www.treetops-riverhuts.com</a>) or Khao Sok Rainforest Resort (<a href="http://www.krabidir.com/khaosokrainforest" title="www.krabidir.com/khaosokrainforest">www.krabidir.com/khaosokrainforest</a>).  
* I never went to the Andaman Coast as the tsunami had just hit, so youâre on your own for that, although Iâve heard that before the tsunami Koh Phi Phi and the other surrounding islands with their limestone cliffs were picturesque.

â¢ Visit Wat Po (Reclining Buddha) and get a traditional Thai massage at the temple.
â¢ Ride the BTS skytrain everywhere!  Skip the taxis and the tuktuksâ¦theyâll try to rip you off unless you know where you are going!  Always tell taxi drivers to run the meter so you donât get ripped off!  Or if you feel like bargaining, you can bargain with them!

    <div class="content">

  Siem Reap (Angkor Wat): The best way to go to Siem Reap from Phnom Penh is to ride the boat up the Mekong.  But, itâs long and hot, so if you would rather do it the quicker, but expensive way, take a plane.

Driver in Siem Reap - John arranged it for us, as Seiha had driven him and visiting family members before....Seiha is a nice young man in his 20's.  He wrote me an email last year, and I know he has a different job now, but perhaps he might have a friend that may be able to drive you around...A few years ago, we paid him $50 for two people for two days of driving to and from guesthouse and to the temples.

Lodging: The Red Piano Guesthouse (where Angelina Jolie and crew stayed)
            Many guesthouses surrounding the area
	* Eat at funky cool restaurant down the street that has crocodiles under the floor, different funky levels, internet, funky signs outside the restaurantâ¦.really cool.
â¢ Visit the Crocodile Farm ($2)
â¢ Ride the Angkor Balloon (hot air balloon ride) â located 1 km on the west side of the Angkor Wat entrance, get a birdâs eye view of the temples
â¢ If you can wake up early enough, visit Angkor Wat at Sunrise 
â¢ Climb up and visit the famous temple at sunset
â¢ Ride bicycles around the Angkor Wat temple area
â¢ Visit the Bayon (54 faces temple)

Check out the White Elephant Trekking company and sign up for a 2 or 3 day trek.  I did a 2 day trek ($55 US), where we hiked for a total of 20 km from Luang Prabang to Baan Houay Nok, stayed overnight in a Khamu village and visited Hmong villages, and then kayaked down the Naam Khan River (12 km) for 3 hours until the new bridge.  Our local guides were wonderful, the decline down was crazy, and the native villagers were so kind and wonderful.  

Go to the Kuang Si Waterfalls.  (15,000 kip plus 40,000 kip taxi ride) - Try to get there early..We got there at 11:30 am and left at 2 pm, just in time to miss the rush of tourists.  It might take a couple hours, but keep climbing all the way to the top!  It's worth it!! You can swim in the cool, clean water, where it's not crowded with others, and look down below at all the other falls.  When we were there, monks came up to enjoy the fresh water as well!  

Wake up early at 6 am and get your camera ready to watch the monks give morning alms along the main street.  It is a very interesting tradition.

Eat breakfast and watch free movies in the evening at Le Stranger, a cool bookhouse with a cafe upstairs (decorated with saa paper lanterns and National Geographic magazines).  

Rent bicycles and ride around town.

Get a massage at the Lao Red Cross.

Climb up to Wat Phousi.

Visit the Royal Museum.

Visit all the temples in the area.  The wat with the white arched entryways have beautiful mosaics on the temple walls.  Most wats cost 1000 kip to visit.

Visit the Pak Ou Caves...I didn't and some say it's not that great, but for a ride along the river and photgraphy, it might be something to check out.

Go to Pao Vhao resort...This is a beautiful 5 star resort with a breathtaking pool.  If you're not a guest there, it costs $10 to go to the pool.  You can see Wat Phousi across the way, and swim in the nice pool set on the hillside.  

Eat at Dao Fa Restaurant for pasta and crepes.

Eat the local Lao noodle soup.

Shop at the night market for handicrafts (I have my saa paper lanterns and my swirlie pillow cases adorning my room right now!).<br class="clear" />

  <p>If you want to have a unique experience, try <a href="http://www.esthersguesthouse.ch/sites/schlafenimstrohenglisch.htm" title="Sleeping in Straw" target="_blank">sleeping on straw</a> in Switzerland!&nbsp; We came to know about it from Rick Steve&#39;s Germany,Austria &amp; Switzerland guidebook. In a small village near Lauterbrunnen called Gimmelwald, you can sleep in a barn on hay beds from June to October for just 20CHF per night .. and that includes a good breakfast.&nbsp; Lots of blankets are provided and you can make your own bed with those or use your own sleeping bag. &nbsp;</p><p>It was cold when we went there in september and I had to use multiple blankets.&nbsp; The barn was pretty clean - cows were out in summer time grazing in fields. So it wasn&#39;t really smelly as I had expected.&nbsp; Also we got to interact with many other travellers most of whom had come there for the same reason - to have a different kind of experience!&nbsp;</p><p>Gimmelwald itself is a nice little swiss village.&nbsp; Very peaceful and quiet with smiling and friendly locals (most of whom have the last name Von Allmen!) and lots of greenery with plenty of cows! Its close to Murren and on the way to Schilthorn.&nbsp; We had the most relaxing time there and also got to experience a cheese festival during our stay.&nbsp; <br /> </p><br class="clear" />

  <p>Hi there,<br /> </p><p>I happened to come to your site via a link to it from a blog. and feel its a great way for you to get info from other travellers.&nbsp; Since you&#39;ve already been to India and NewZealand, I wouldn&#39;t add entries for those. However, I do wish you would include Spain in your journeys. &nbsp;</p><p>I went to Spain by chance - for a conference.&nbsp; But decided to extend my trip and do some site seeing.&nbsp; My husband joined me and we went to Barcelona (this is where the conference was), Seville, Madrid and Toledo.&nbsp; Barcelona and Madrid are the usual big cities but each one has its own unique feature. Barcelona is loaded with Gaudi architecture while Madrid&#39;s museums just filled us with awe.&nbsp; But the one city I liked the most was Seville.&nbsp; Inspite of being a city, Seville has a small town feel.&nbsp; We stayed in the center - Barrillo de Santa Cruz.&nbsp; The biggest church of europe was pretty close by - walking distance and so was the Moorish palace - Alcazar.&nbsp; What we liked the most was the relaxed atmosphere. Walking through the streets of Barrillo (with orange laden trees) or taking evening &quot;paseo&quot; at the river, we seemed to be the only people around.&nbsp; Of course that could also means most localites and other tourists were taking siesta. Coz we saw a totally different scene at night.&nbsp; Even on a weekday, the restaurants opened at 9:30 pm&nbsp; (the tapas were yummy!!)&nbsp; and the bars started filling up only after midnight (they opened at 11 pm!). Flamenco music played in most bars, and localites showed off their flamenco dancing talent. We learnt a few steps too from a local group!</p><p>Of course you cannot leave Seville without seeing a professional flamenco performance and if Sachi is interested, trying out a flamenco dress!! Oh and how can I forget Churros! These delicious fritters dipped in chocolate were our breakfast and snacks for many a days.&nbsp;</p><p>I really fell in love with this city and would love to return there sometime in future. I hope you will add Seville to your itinerary.</p><p>Vandy&nbsp;</p><p>PS: send me an email if you want a link to my Spain photos <br /> </p><br class="clear" />
