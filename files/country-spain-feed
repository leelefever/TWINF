 <title>Barcelona Restaurant - El Cargol</title>
 <link>http://www.theworldisnotflat.com/blog/dave-h/barcelona-restaurant-el-cargol</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Lee and Sachi,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;When I was in Barcelona my sister took me to a local family run restaurant that served a multiple servings, family style meal that was fantastic and unlike anything else I ate in Barcelona.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#39;s called El Cargol and is somewhere in the outskirts of Barcelona (you need a car to get there).&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#39;ll update with more location info and possibly a local contact to go with when my sister gets back to me.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#39;d highly recommend it if you have a car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Dave H&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;clear&quot; /&gt;&lt;table id=&quot;attachments&quot;&gt;

 <title>Seville</title>
 <link>http://www.theworldisnotflat.com/blog/vandy/seville</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I happened to come to your site via a link to it from a blog. and feel its a great way for you to get info from other travellers.&amp;nbsp; Since you&amp;#39;ve already been to India and NewZealand, I wouldn&amp;#39;t add entries for those. However, I do wish you would include Spain in your journeys. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went to Spain by chance - for a conference.&amp;nbsp; But decided to extend my trip and do some site seeing.&amp;nbsp; My husband joined me and we went to Barcelona (this is where the conference was), Seville, Madrid and Toledo.&amp;nbsp; Barcelona and Madrid are the usual big cities but each one has its own unique feature. Barcelona is loaded with Gaudi architecture while Madrid&amp;#39;s museums just filled us with awe.&amp;nbsp; But the one city I liked the most was Seville.&amp;nbsp; Inspite of being a city, Seville has a small town feel.&amp;nbsp; We stayed in the center - Barrillo de Santa Cruz.&amp;nbsp; The biggest church of europe was pretty close by - walking distance and so was the Moorish palace - Alcazar.&amp;nbsp; What we liked the most was the relaxed atmosphere. Walking through the streets of Barrillo (with orange laden trees) or taking evening &amp;quot;paseo&amp;quot; at the river, we seemed to be the only people around.&amp;nbsp; Of course that could also means most localites and other tourists were taking siesta. Coz we saw a totally different scene at night.&amp;nbsp; Even on a weekday, the restaurants opened at 9:30 pm&amp;nbsp; (the tapas were yummy!!)&amp;nbsp; and the bars started filling up only after midnight (they opened at 11 pm!). Flamenco music played in most bars, and localites showed off their flamenco dancing talent. We learnt a few steps too from a local group!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course you cannot leave Seville without seeing a professional flamenco performance and if Sachi is interested, trying out a flamenco dress!! Oh and how can I forget Churros! These delicious fritters dipped in chocolate were our breakfast and snacks for many a days.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really fell in love with this city and would love to return there sometime in future. I hope you will add Seville to your itinerary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vandy&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS: send me an email if you want a link to my Spain photos &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;clear&quot; /&gt;</description>

 <title>Garganta del Chorro</title>
 <link>http://www.theworldisnotflat.com/blog/nancytubbs/garganta-del-chorro</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I glimsed this gorge from the train windows over 10 years ago, and have wanted to return ever since.&amp;nbsp; There is a little trail, with a platform stuck onto sheer cliff walls, that looks unbelievable unsafe and exciting.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andalucia.com/antequera/chorro/home.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.andalucia.com/antequera/chorro/home.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you check it out and tell us about it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;clear&quot; /&gt;</description>
