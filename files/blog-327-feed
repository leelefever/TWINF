 <link>http://www.theworldisnotflat.com/blog/nila-tanzil/exploring-yogyakarta-indonesia-in-3-days</link>
 <description>I managed to go to Yogyakarta with my classmate from The Netherlands, Danny. He&#039;s never been to Indonesia before and would love to see Candi Borobudur :D. So, we decided to go to Yogya for three days. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

As soon as we arrived, we strolled down to Malioboro Street, where all the souvenirs and batik shops were located. We did some shopping there. Hehehe.. Danny was amazed by the cheap price of all the stuffs that were sold in that street. Malioboro Street is famous for that. It offers different kinds of stuffs for extremely cheap price! Oyeah, one has to bargain to get a good deal. ;) So, your bargaining skills are very useful here! I bought everything for not more than Rp 10thou. It wasn&#039;t even 1 euro, yet!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

After the shopping, I decided to take him to Gadjah Wong Restaurant for dinner coz I read a lot of good things about it from some magazines. Apparently, it was a good decision as the place itself is very nice with an open air garden and different parts of rooms with different kind of live music – traditional Javanese music, jazz and country music. We chose to sit in a small garden, outdoor, where we could be entertain by the singers and gamelan players who were wearing traditional costumes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

When exploring the place, I was stunned to see the dungeon-like entrance to the underground room in which decorated with Wisnu statues and other ancient-like ornaments. Very artistic, I love it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The food was delicious. Apart from Indonesian food, they also have Indian and some steaks. I ordered Indian vegetable curry, while Danny ordered Nasi Bebek, the restaurant’s specialty, .. and we were satisfied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

After a nice dinner, we went back to Malioboro Street, Danny bought more stuffs for his sisters, nephew, dad and friends. The art of bargaining started to kick back now... hahaha :D.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

People in Yogyakarta are nice and friendly. When you walked along the Malioboro Street, you would get offer from the “becak&lt;br class=&quot;clear&quot; /&gt;</description>
