      <h2><a href="/dispatch/2006/07/27/anatomy-of-a-scam-in-vietnam" title="Anatomy of a Scam in Vietnam">Anatomy of a Scam in Vietnam</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on July 27, 2006 - 8:22am</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>It&rsquo;s been said many times- be clear with a Vietnamese cab driver about your hotel, or they will take you to their friend&rsquo;s hotel, where they will earn a commission.  We&rsquo;ve seen many attempts at such diversions, but none so blatant as we experienced today, just after arriving in Hanoi.  </p><p>We took a cab from the airport into town (37km for US$10). On the way, we told the driver to go to the &ldquo;Camellia 3&rdquo; Hotel and showed him where it was on the map.  He agreed and the agreement was settled.  Along the way he had a number of phone calls, which rang in a ring tone with the volume on 11. We understood nothing he said.  </p><p>Upon arriving in the Old City of Hanoi, a young Vietnamese guy walked over to the car, opened my door, stuck his head into the car about 3 inches from my face and said &ldquo;<i>Welcome to the Camellia 3 Hotel!</i>&rdquo;  I struggled to look around him at the building and the awning and did not see anything about the Camellia, or any hotel for that matter. No matter what we asked, he continued to insist, quite rudely &ldquo;<i>Yes, this is the place, the Camellia 3 Hotel, let me get your bags.</i>&rdquo; All I could say was, &ldquo;<i>First, please back up and let me get out of the car.</i>&rdquo;  I left Sachi in the car and stepped into what was supposed to be the Camellia 3 Hotel.  I walked to the reception desk and said &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;d like a business card please, where is your business card?</i>&rdquo;  Their answer:  &ldquo;<i>We ran out</i>&rdquo;.  This, of course was a lie and there was no longer any doubt what was happening. This was not the Camellia 3 Hotel.  </p><p>The cab driver must have thought we were complete idiots.  He actually thought that he could drop us off at some random hotel and we would believe, thanks to the not-so-skillful scamming of his not-so-sly cronies, that we had arrived at our requested destination and would blindly get a room, earning him a commission.  </p><p>We&rsquo;ve met a lot of nice people in Vietnam, but it is the prevalence of this kind of bullshit that will forever leave a bad taste in my mouth.  We said to him what we say to all people who try to pull such stunts.  &ldquo;<i>You are bad for tourists &ndash; you keep doing this, tourists will stop coming</i>.&rdquo;  He only smiled with a &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t win&rsquo;em all&rdquo; attitude and went off to give another tourist a good reason not to come back to Vietnam. </p><br class="clear" />

The trail to the lake ended by a sickly looking and very sad monkey on a chain. Not a highlight.<span>&nbsp; </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/74-195255886_bd236f727f.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span></span>On the way back we realized that most Vietnamese never get a chance to ride in a gandola, so it is not only transportation, but an attraction itself. It may be no matter that the destination is an anti-climax.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">The restaurant situation in Da Lat was also a bit strange to us.<span>&nbsp; </span>First, there are very few actual restaurants in Da Lat.<span>&nbsp; </span>Instead, there are cafes that have a very consistent menu consisting of eight pages of drinks and ice cream and one page of food, including, invariably, six kinds of spaghetti.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course, there are also many street stalls offering baguettes, three varieties of snails, meat on sticks and pho.<span>&nbsp; </span>What we didn&#39;t find were any up-market Vietnamese restaurants.<span>&nbsp; </span>We found very few places to go out and get a nice Vietnamese dinner.<span>&nbsp; </span>The restaurants on offer focused mainly on western food with some Asian foods in the mix.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span>Being the honeymoon capital of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>, we were left wondering if we were missing something.<span>&nbsp; </span>Where do the Vietnamese vacationers eat?<span>&nbsp; </span>In the end, we realized that Da Lat is not for us- it is not built around the needs and expectations of the Western traveler. The Vietnemese may not go out to eat Vietnamese food in nice restaurants to celebrate (or the places are well hidden). It is a Vietnamese place that serves the Vietnamese people first, as it should.<span>&nbsp; </span>While Da Lat may not have lived up to what we imagined, it offered a quirky, strange, cool and interesting look at Vietnamese vacation culture and for that we are thankful.</p>  <br class="clear" />

    <p class="MsoNormal">Even at a first glance, <st1:place>Saigon</st1:place> (officially named <st1:city><st1:place>Ho Chi Minh City</st1:place></st1:city>) reveals a striking difference in transportation. We knew that <st1:place>SE  Asia</st1:place> is very fond of the motorcycle, but <st1:place>Saigon</st1:place> takes the use of the motorcycle to a new level.<span>&nbsp; </span>At any major intersection on a weekday, you might find 100 motorcycles waiting for the light to change.<span>&nbsp; </span>Outside of nearly every place of business is a group of motorcycles parked and likely blocking the sidewalk.<span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/73-190117663_eaaccf0b9c.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p> <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Notice the woman riding side-saddle below- very common.</p> <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/60-190117322_899c58d8c1.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>   <p class="MsoNormal">While there are more motorcycles, there seem to be fewer people per motorcycle than we saw in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region> or <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp; </span>I wonder if a measure of economic prosperity could be the average number of people (and/or animals) piled onto a single motorcycle on any given workday?&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/45-190117171_1364e863a3.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>   <p class="MsoNormal">We&rsquo;ve learned that if you wait for a chance to cross the street in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>, you will never cross because the motos fill up everything.<span>&nbsp; </span>The key is to take the courageous step into the traffic and let the traffic move around you. Once you start walking, keep up a steady pace so the traffic can predict your movement.<span>&nbsp; </span>Look into traffic for a diagonal line between the motos that leads you across the street. It also helps to find a blocker (a local who crosses with you).<span>&nbsp; See <a href="http://www.hobotraveler.com/183_26_howtocrossthestreet.shtml">Andy&#39;s excellent guide to crossing the street</a>.<br />  </span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>   <p class="MsoNormal">Other than the motorcycles, <st1:place>Saigon</st1:place> doesn&rsquo;t seem to be striking in any particular way form a tourist perspective.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is a big city (7 million people) and is quite a bit nicer than we expected.<span>&nbsp; </span>We found it to be cleaner than <st1:city><st1:place>Bangkok</st1:place></st1:city> in terms of air quality and street trash. Staying in the Dong Khoi area of district one, we found a built-for-westerners feel that mixed Vietnamese kitsch with real culture and modern convenience.<span>&nbsp; </span>We stayed in the Kim Long Hotel for US$30 per night, including in-room Internet access and breakfast. </p>     <p class="MsoNormal">Any American visiting <st1:place>Saigon</st1:place> should visit the <st1:place><st1:placename>War</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Remnants</st1:placename>  <st1:placetype>Museum</st1:placetype></st1:place>, which was formerly called &ldquo;The Museum of American War Crimes&rdquo;. Remembering that <st1:country-region><st1:place>Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> was a Communist country and is still Socialist, it should not be surprising that the museum is factual but decidedly one-sided.<span>&nbsp; </span>It offers a look at the Vietnamese perspective of the war and does a thorough job of outlining American atrocities, including the use and ongoing effects of Agent Orange and napalm. <span>&nbsp;</span>Being used to a more balanced perspective in most museums, it was interesting to us both to experience a state-run organization that accepted no responsibility to tell any other sides of the story. It left us both shaking our heads at the horrors of war and with a perspective on how the war was perceived by <st1:country-region><st1:place>Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>, albeit from a propagandist perspective.&nbsp; </p>   <br class="clear" />

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on May 8, 2006 - 5:56am</div>

    <div class="content">

    <p class="MsoNormal"><st1:city><st1:place></st1:place></st1:city><br /><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/24-141942168_98e7fb6cf9.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Sumo wrestling is a truly Japanese affair dating back some 1500 years.<span>&nbsp; </span>According to our handy sumo pamphlet that we received at the first day of the <a href="http://www.sumo.or.jp/eng/">Tokyo Grand Sumo Tournament</a>, it started as a religious activity dedicated to the gods with prayers for a bountiful harvest.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Sumo practiced today is heavily influenced by ancient tradition and ceremony.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, it sometimes seems like a ceremony where wrestling suddenly breaks out.</p>      <p class="MsoNormal">Most impressive for me was the sheer size of the wrestlers.<span>&nbsp; </span>I swear one of their legs weighs more than me.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yet, they move surprisingly quickly. There are no weight limits, so wrestlers of very different sizes may face off making for a battle of speed over brawn. Some of the biggest are actually white guys from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Yugoslavia</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Bulgaria</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of them, Kotooshu, is a contender for becoming a yokozuna- the coveted position of highest rank.<br /><img src="/files/includes/images/39-141942071_996b454974.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /><o:p> <br /></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Each match, particularly in the more competitive classes, is a dramatic event with the wrestlers facing off, kicking their feet high in the air, stomping down and then stepping away, as if the moment was just not right (the shikiri).<span>&nbsp; </span>They go to their corners, drink water, wipe sweat and slap themselves before then next face off.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/39-141942112_36e1337acc.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Once both wrestlers are ready, they come together (the tachi-ai) in what sometimes looks like a slapping contest, each defending himself by pushing away the upper body of the other, who is often trying to reach for his mawashi (the only clothing- a silk loincloth).<span>&nbsp; </span>There are 82 winning tricks and most involve gripping and leveraging the mawashi.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contest is decided when a wrestler (rishiki) falls down in the circular ring (dohyo) or is forced outside it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most matches are over in a matter of seconds and ends the day for both wrestlers (one day of 15 in a grand tournament).</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/42-141942271_ad4052ee03.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /><o:p> <br /></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">The tournament is an all day affair, but the action really happens between <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4-6pm</st1:time>.<span>&nbsp; </span>At the Ryogoku Kokugikan Arena, spectators can rent FM radios and hear announcers in English for a deposit of 2000 yen.<span>&nbsp; </span>We liked the insight, but you had to deal with overt cheesiness on the behalf of the American announcer who would say things like &ldquo;Whoa! get out the maple syrup!<span>&nbsp; </span>He made a pancake with that move!&rdquo; &lt;groan&gt;.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">All in all, a great Japanese experience. Anyone visiting <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city> should try to make a day of a tournament. Our mid-range tickets cost about US$75 per person.</p><br class="clear" />

    <p class="MsoNormal">Rudyard Kipling was said to have facetiously suggested that <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> should be put under a glass case as it is too pretty to be part of the real world.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now, about 100 years later, I feel the same about what I&rsquo;ve seen of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan-</st1:place></st1:country-region> it seems too good to be true.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/55-141671240_ebd7a04a10.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Throughout our journey, I&rsquo;ve struggled with the <a href="/dispatch/2006/03/23/authenticity-and-tourism-in-india">authenticity of the tourist experience</a>.<span>&nbsp; </span>In so many places the experience of the tourists seems manufactured with cultural dress, performances and practices being on display with the tourist dollar front-of-mind.<span>&nbsp; </span>As such, I&rsquo;ve become a little cynical about the tourist experience in places like India&rsquo;s Golden Triangle, where it &lsquo;s obvious that the essence of the true culture is sometimes being abstracted and displayed in a way that cheapens and demeans it to a point that it becomes unreal or inauthentic.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">In contrast, the daily experience in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> serves as a full helping of culture that is free from the pretense of purely tourist displays.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example, we are staying in a district of Tokyo called Monzen Nakacho which is far from the tourist trail and offers a true-to-life view of daily life in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan-</st1:place></st1:country-region> a view that, to me, seems authentically real but still unreal in a too-good-to-be-true sort of way.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/52-141361326_d2544b99ff.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Just a block from our hotel is a street that leads to a beautiful Buddhist temple. Along this street are authentic Japanese restaurants and shops filled with Japanese locals, slurping their noodles and drinking their tea just as they do every day.<span>&nbsp; </span>The street itself is stunning in it&rsquo;s cleanliness and style, as if someone set out to create the quintessential Japanese street scene, complete with lanterns, cherry trees, friendly people and noodle shop owners rolling noodles from scratch right there on display.&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/51-141361379_ac35cca621.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p class="MsoNormal">What is most striking to me is that this scene is, without a doubt, the real thing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tourists were not considered when this street became a reality.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is simply a random street in a nice neighborhood of locals that came to being in an authentically Japanese way.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Each evening when we go out, we invariably see women and sometimes men wearing the traditional kimono.<span>&nbsp; </span>Like the shops above, these folks are not thinking of tourists, or making money, or anything but what they feel is the proper attire for their evening out. To the tourists, this is a treat- to see such an authentic and truly beautiful expression of culture in daily life.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/45-141361809_2696416735.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="500" width="375" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">We&rsquo;ve witnessed authentic local culture in many places and I don&rsquo;t mean to sound like authenticity is hard to find.<span>&nbsp; </span>In <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city> though, it seems to take on a new level of uniqueness and in a environment that is perfectly clean and extremely well-cared for- and that is a big difference.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">It&rsquo;s no wonder I have a crush on <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city>.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&quot;m excited to get out of the city and experience more of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>. </p>  <br class="clear" />

    <div class="content">

  <p>We have to admit that the movie &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; has left an indelible mark on our expectations of what your supposed to do in Tokyo. There is surely no better place on earth to experience the karaoke phenomenon and last night we repeated the experience of the characters in the movie and rented a karaoke cube for two hours- from about 1:15-3:15AM at a cost of US$58 including a drink and two dishes of gyoza. (Karaoke is singing along to music videos you choose.) </p><p>Of course, you can&#39;t fully experience karoake without a few drinks, so we also went to have dinner and take part the famous Roppongi nightlife.&nbsp; Once again, Sachi&#39;s japanese skills enabled us to find restaurants that do not cater to foreigners and have menus that look like this:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-140675751_1f8355afdc.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>We had sashimi.&nbsp;</p><p>Roppongi is known as a place where foreigners go for nightlife and there are hundreds of bars, taking up the first 5 stories of real estate for many blocks.&nbsp; For some surreal atomsphere- we went to a reggae bar (in Tokyo remember), where I played darts with a guy named &quot;Hide&quot;. Later we went to the Motown Bar, where I couldn&#39;t believe the popularity of the Mexican beer Corona and the number of attentive bartenders. The service in Tokyo is amazing.<br /></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/46-140675578_d8fe3de876.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Having sufficiently found new courage, we were ready for karaoke, which I have to admit was very, very fun.&nbsp; I think Seattle needs a karaoke cube joint.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/47-140675611_379f4b3c0c.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/51-140675663_9e93c7e647.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Here are selection of the songs we sang:</p><ul><li>Sitting on the Dock of the Bay - Otis Redding</li><li>Pretty Woman -&nbsp; Roy Orbison</li><li>You Give Love A Bad Name - Bon Jovi</li><li>I Will Survive - Gloria Gaynor</li><li>Sweet Caroline - Neil Diamond</li><li>Sexual Healing - Marvin Gaye</li><li>Dancing Queen - AbbA</li><li>My Life - Billy Joel</li><li>King of the Road - Roger Miller</li></ul><p>&nbsp;Inquirys should be directed to our agent. </p><br class="clear" />
