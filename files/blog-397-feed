 <description>&lt;p&gt;Two friends and I spend a wonderful Easter weekend on the island of Naxos a few years ago.&amp;nbsp; It is an enchanting island that is not overly touristy.&amp;nbsp; Its a good place for some R&amp;amp;R as well as hiking (if you&amp;#39;re so inclined).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hotel we stayed at was one of the best budget accommodations I&amp;#39;ve ever experienced - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greekhotel.com/cyclades/naxos/chora/grotta/home.htm&quot; title=&quot;Hotel Grotta&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hotel Grotta&lt;/a&gt;, run by a brother and sister. &amp;nbsp; The rooms are spacious and have TV, phone, nice bathrooms (although I don&amp;#39;t know about wireless).&amp;nbsp; Some have veranda views of the ocean.&amp;nbsp; The highlight of the experience - hands down - is the traditional Greek breakfast.&amp;nbsp; Buffet style yogurt, honey, cheese, bread, meats, honey cake, juice . . . its included in the room price, and you will be well fortified for your activities later in the day!&amp;nbsp; We paid ~ US$45 a night for a triple room in 2001.&amp;nbsp; And they gave us a bottle of wine!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimitrios was kind enough to loan my friends and I a well-worn copy of &lt;i&gt;Walking Tours of Naxos.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp; This slim guide has short to medium-length walks to see such sites as ancient Kouros and temples.&amp;nbsp; You can see one of the most iconic ancient ruins as you sail into the harbor of Naxos town - the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=naxos,+greece&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=18&amp;amp;ll=37.109463,25.372576&amp;amp;spn=0.002143,0.005059&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;om=1&amp;amp;iwloc=addr&quot; title=&quot;freestanding gate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;freestanding gate&lt;/a&gt; that was part of a temple to Apollo that was never finished. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spent 3 days on Naxos and were able to visit some of the smaller towns (Ano Sagri, another town at the North end of the island - Apollonas, maybe?). &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;clear&quot; /&gt;</description>
