    <div class="content">

    <p class="MsoNormal">It&rsquo;s quite apparent that the Russians have mixed feelings about <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> (depending on where you ask) and after a few days there I think we feel the same. It was at once harsh and smooth, rude and friendly, ugly and beautiful.<span>&nbsp; </span>Overall though, I&rsquo;d say it was better than I expected.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/105-252293946_b2e37f4a21.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Of course we had friends in the city that showed us around their neighborhoods and homes, which was a perfect introduction to the city. The warmth of the personal connection with people in <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> made us feel at home.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, once we ventured out on our own, other sides of the city appeared</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/95-252293749_5a1db75ef7.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Suddenly I found myself in center of the former Communist stronghold, surrounded by reminders of the Bolshevik Revolution, the <st1:country-region><st1:place>USSR</st1:place></st1:country-region> and Communism.<span>&nbsp; </span>I saw the Kremlin-adjacent apartments where Stalin&rsquo;s cronies were arrested and shot.<span>&nbsp; </span>I ate at places where people once stood in line for bread.<span>&nbsp; </span>All the things I learned about the Russians and Communism were right there before me and I could feel the power.<span>&nbsp; </span>In <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> the grandeur of the buildings are awe-inspiring &ndash; monuments to a government that controlled 1/6<sup>th</sup> of the earth&rsquo;s surface and had plans for world domination.<span>&nbsp; </span>This was the place, right under my feet.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/95-252294291_a25f28aa21.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">And it is beautiful.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tiananmen has nothing on <st1:place>Red Square</st1:place>. The parks, rivers and thoroughfares are quite delightful, especially on a nice day. <span>&nbsp;</span>I had no idea that <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> was covered in parks. The legendary Metro subway system is showing its age, but still maintains a world class level of elegance and efficiency.<span>&nbsp; </span>The street food is always-on and yummy. The drab and cold <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> I expected was a distant vision, but some of what I had heard was confirmed.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">It is said that <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> is the &ldquo;dictator&rdquo; and <st1:city><st1:place>St. Petersburg</st1:place></st1:city> is the &ldquo;artist&rdquo; and having visited both, it is obvious why.<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> is not a warm and fuzzy sort of place for the visitor.<span>&nbsp; </span>Customer service is very short and cold, there is no English anywhere and downtown sometimes seems covered in police. The people you encounter appear quite gloomy with very few smiles. Also, there is no affordable lodging in the center of town, forcing travelers 20 minutes outside the city.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/100-252293791_9f5acf5def.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">One of the important things that travelers must remember in <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> is to carry copies of their visa and passport with them at all times.<span>&nbsp; </span>Often police/military will stop foreigners and ask for passports to extort large sums of money.<span>&nbsp; </span>If an actual passport is handed over, it may cost to get it back.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of our friends was caught urinating outdoors by a young military officer in an oversized uniform and threatened with the &ldquo;Gulag&rdquo; if he didn&rsquo;t hand over his actual passport instead of copies. Our friend pretended to call his embassy which caused the officer to reduced the penalty to 500 Rubles (USD$20).<span>&nbsp; </span>They ended up settling at 200 Rubles. To be fair to both sides &ndash; public restrooms are impossible to find in <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city>, and the military boys do not get paid one ruble for their two years of mandated service.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/108-252294153_375d086a33.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">On the other side of the coin, the personal experiences we had with random Muscovites were more positive.<span>&nbsp; </span>While looking at a map on a street corner one night (the &ldquo;tourist distress call&rdquo;) a friendly young woman pointed us in the right direction.<span>&nbsp; </span>It seems that in general, the young people represent a new generation of Muscovites who are more likely to smile, provide great service and welcome foreigners.<span>&nbsp; </span>I would love to come back to <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> in 15 years to see how it has changed.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m quite sure that it will be less of a dictator.</p>  <br class="clear" />

  <p>From the moment we arrived in Yekaterinburg, Russia, I had the song &quot;<a href="http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Modest-Mouse/The-Cold-Part.html">The Cold Part</a>&quot; by Modest Mouse playing in my head, which is  a dark and desolate song that sings &quot;so long to this cold, cold part of the world&quot;.  I don&#39;t think the city is as cold and dark as I chose to display in the video, but I do think the video fits with the soundtrack that was playing in my head at the time.</p>    <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9F8FtXTJTe8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"></embed>  <p>The scenes at the end are from our homestay in Yaketerinburg.  We stayed with a local named Eleana for two nights in former Communist housing blocks.  She was nice, but was caring for a friend who was sick at the time and we have both become ill after staying with her. The housing was warm on the inside, scary on the outside. </p>  <p>Yakaterinburg is famous for the deaths of the last czarist family in Russia, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanovs">Romanovs</a>, who were killed in a cellar in the city by the Communist Revolutionaries as a symbol of the end of their imperial rule. A sad and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/133725.stm">controversial story</a>.</p>  <p>Yekaterineburg is at the imaginary border between Asia (and Siberia) and Europe, so the song even fit as we left...</p>  <p><i>so long to this cold, cold part of the world</i></p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on September 3, 2006 - 5:33pm</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>I&#39;m a little conflicted about Shanghai after spending about 10 days there. Without a doubt, it is an amazingly modern, shiny, commercially-oriented city that is becoming a 21st century New York City or Hong Kong.&nbsp; It&#39;s alive with energy and fun.&nbsp; However, I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it, but it feels like something is missing.&nbsp; Sometimes I feel like Shanghai has no heart. </p><p>For the traveler, Shanghai offers only glimpses of old Shanghai.&nbsp; Everyday the old parts of the city are being bulldozed to make room for skyscrapers and shopping centers. Shanghai is not a place to reflect on the past, but consider the future.&nbsp; Modern commercialism is alive and well in Shanghai and it sometimes beats you over the head.&nbsp; As a Dutch guy we met put it &quot;I feel like a walking wallet in Shanghai&quot;. Indeed.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/76-225716135_f8c3714965.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Many times we&#39;ve discussed how China is more like a young country than an ancient one.&nbsp; Some say that it is only about 20 years old because the Mao&#39;s Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) essentially erased all things Chinese. I think this is the case with Shanghai - it is like a teenager who is working hard to find the identity that will define them as an adult.&nbsp; The symbol of this adolescence to me is the Pearl City Tower.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/81-225715964_ac5b1665f7.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;The tower was built in 1994 and I imagine that it was to be a symbol of a city that is focused on the future.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I think the tower looks less like the future and more like what people thought the future would look like in 1950.&nbsp; With garish pink glass and blinking colored lights at night, the tower appears dated and conflicts with the elegance found elsewhere in the city. I chalk it up to a teenage &quot;phase&quot;.</p><p>The elegance I refer to can be found in the same picture above on the right - the 88 story JinMao tower. One of the top 5 tallest buildings in the world and built four years after the Pearl City, I consider one of the most beautiful skyscrapers I&#39;ve seen.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/91-233326710_2fe650e9fd.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>And the inside is equally as impressive - especially the highest hotel in the world, the Grand Hyatt Shanghai.&nbsp; The hotel starts on the 56th floor and reaches 33 stories to the top, including a dizzying atrium the whole way up.&nbsp; We checked- rooms cost about US$240 and it&#39;s located in Pudong- a business district.  </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/48-230788723_d5ba9086a5.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;One of Shanghai&#39;s proud possessions is a what is called the &quot;fastest train in the world&quot; called the <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/shanghai-maglev-train">MagLev (Magnetic Levetation)</a>.&nbsp; We were a little disappointed because the top operational speed is supposed to be 429 kph (267 mph) but our train only got to 301 kph (the speed is displayed inside).&nbsp; Still impressive, but I think we were a little spoiled by the <a href="/47/shinkansen">Japanese Shinkansen</a>, which offers a much smoother ride, despite not floating on air.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/75-230786979_c9bce15148.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;If you get a chance, I sincerely recommend getting a haircut in another country.&nbsp; It offers a truly local experience.&nbsp; I chose to go to a place that was a bit more stylish than I would at home, but it was worth it (US$8).&nbsp; Approximately 75% of the time I spent there, I was being massaged, which was a total surprise - all I needed was clippers and I could do the haircut myself.&nbsp; As <a href="http://www.justagwailo.com/">Richard</a> mentioned - this photo looks like I&#39;m being mercilessly attacked with a machete. It&#39;s just an arm massage. </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/58-229652030_fdeab3036a.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;The Shanghai folks are surely the most stylish in China that we have seen and just as concerned with the darkening effects of the sun as others in Asia, where whitening creams are advertised everywhere.&nbsp; The photo below was taken in the sun- not the rain.&nbsp; All the umbrellas are for the sun and represent a giant hazard to my eyes.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/74-229651109_5f5d9dcb1f.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Despite some of my mixed feelings, I really did enjoy the time in Shanghai and would go back in a second.&nbsp; I suppose I just had different expectations. It is clear from being there that it is a city of the future.&nbsp; What Shanghai will become and how they deal with things like air quality is going to be very interesting. &nbsp;</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/90-233326768_6a4f50085f.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><br class="clear" />

We doubt there will be Internet access, so you may not hear from us for a week or so.  Until then, <a href="/47/questions">ask us some questions</a>! :)</p> <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leelefever/217763850/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="/files/includes/images/86-217763850_786968357f.jpg" alt="Our Route to Shanghai" height="375" width="500" /></a></p>    <br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/qingping" title="A Wild Goose Chase at the Qingping Market, Guangzhou, China">A Wild Goose Chase at the Qingping Market, Guangzhou, China</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on August 13, 2006 - 5:38pm</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>We&rsquo;ve finally started our month-long journey through <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, starting in the huge and industrial city of <st1:city><st1:place>Guangzhou</st1:place></st1:city>.&nbsp; This city greeted us with a couple of surprises.   </p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Before we left I remember hearing about an amazing market in <st1:city><st1:place>Guangzhou</st1:place></st1:city> where you can find anything that can be eaten &ndash; including wild animals from all over <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Upon hearing about such a market, I made sure it was part of our itinerary.&nbsp; The market is called the Qingping Market and it is one of Chinas largest and most famous, for a few reasons.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Upon arriving in <st1:city><st1:place>Guangzhou</st1:place></st1:city> and the Victory Hotel on <st1:place><st1:placename>Shamian</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Island</st1:placetype></st1:place> (US$50/night) I was happy to find that the Qingping Market was only a few blocks away to the north.&nbsp; We would make a long, 95(f) degree day of it.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">We&rsquo;ve seen our share of street markets over the last 8 months and Qingping is certainly the granddaddy of them all with an unimaginable assortment of anything that can be dried and eaten, from snake skin to deer tendon and bugs, lots of bugs.&nbsp; However, the market left me frustrated.&nbsp; For one thing, it is hard to understand where the market ends and the city begins- there are no maps or signs or information boards (not a big surprise of course).&nbsp; This set us wandering.&nbsp; Second &ndash; as hard as we looked and as many people as we asked, we simply could not find the animals.&nbsp; Where were the stacked cages of raccoons and civet cats?&nbsp; Where is the roasted dog?&nbsp; Everyone who has visited this place has <a href="http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Asia/China/Guangdong_Sheng/Guangzhou-1017747/Things_To_Do-Guangzhou-Qing_Ping_Market-BR-1.html">been disgusted by it</a> and dammit- we want to see why! <o:p></o:p></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">So we searched and asked more people and even got a map of the area that a person used to denote the location of such a place.&nbsp; This sent us many blocks out of the market on a less-then-figurative wild goose chase. We found nothing.&nbsp; Despite being amazed by buckets of live scorpions, eels, scary looking cats and meat hooks full of unidentifiable meat, we left disappointed that we didn&rsquo;t find the animals.&nbsp; </p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/79-213167515_55bc4af36a.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p class="MsoNormal">It was a frustrating failure for two people who have grown to feel confident in such situations.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Then, upon consulting the Internet, the story began to coalesce.&nbsp; I saw my fist bit of evidence on this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/samsays/118673937/">Flickr photo</a>, which reads: <o:p></o:p></p>    <p class="MsoNormal blockquote">At one time, stores featured many exotic animals (for eating). Today after the SARS scare these are mostly gone, or at least hidden in back alleys.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">HAH!&nbsp; This was it.&nbsp; It was the SARS virus! So, I looked on Google and found a little more information that actually painted the Qingping Market in a wicked light, from a microbial perspective. </p>        <p class="MsoNormal">This <a href="http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jan2004/2004-01-05-03.asp">Environmental News article</a> writes: <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="blockquote">The Guangdong provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced today that experts from Hong Kong and Guangdong have found a large quantity of the SARS-like coronavirus from civet cats and other wildlife collected from markets in Guangzhou and Shenzhen.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/05/0506_030506_sarschina.html">National Geographic writes</a>: <o:p></o:p></p>    <p class="MsoNormal blockquote">Many wild and exotic animals are sold as food in <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, such as these raccoons in stacked cages at the Qingping Market in <st1:city><st1:place>Guangzhou</st1:place></st1:city>. Some scientists warn that such conditions are ideal for a virus to jump from animals to humans, which likely happened in the case of SARS.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Ahh sweet vindication (both for our search and the wild animals)!&nbsp; We had been frustrated because what we were looking for no longer exists or is too well hidden for travelers to find.&nbsp; We were not being rookies- we (and the people we talked to) lacked a specific piece of information about the recent history of the market.&nbsp; SARS had a very positive effect on the market overall, but one that caused us frustration for a day. </p><br class="clear" />

We fell in love with the city over about 6 days.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The incredible efficiency of <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> was most fascinating to me.<span>&nbsp; </span>Looking around, there are so many things that I hope we&rsquo;ll see in <st1:city><st1:place>Seattle</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The first and coolest is the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/en/index.jsp">Octopus Card</a>&rdquo;, which operates like a debit card and works for all city<img src="/files/includes/images/81-208902896_1b8f57901f_m.jpg" align="right" /> transit, 7-11s, McDonalds,&nbsp; <span></span>drug stores, supermarkets etc.<span>&nbsp; </span>Anywhere you see the little Octopus card reader, you can press your card onto it and money will be deducted from your prepaid account.<span>&nbsp; </span>The first time I used it at a 7-11, the first words out of my mouth were &ldquo;holy sh*t that&#39;s efficient!&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>You don&rsquo;t even have to take the card out of a wallet or purse- just hold it over the reader and the money is zapped out. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Last night over dinner we talked to some locals who showed us their Octopus card which had their picture and information on it.<span>&nbsp; </span>For them, the card is used to open the door of their home and other places that require membership.<span>&nbsp; </span>They said that some schools even use Octopus cards for daily attendance.<span>&nbsp; </span>By their estimates, 90-95% of all <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> people have one and most people love it.<span>&nbsp; </span>For people who are worried about privacy or Big Brother, they can choose to get a card with no personal connection.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, they lose some of the convenience.<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Seattle</st1:place></st1:city> needs this.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">In busy restaurants, the servers have wireless ear pieces that are used for constant communications among the staff.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s invisible to the customer, but the communication makes service seem magical, as if they are almost reading your mind.<span>&nbsp; </span>You walk in the door and each server looks up and guides you along your way as you wind through the restaurant.<span>&nbsp; </span>The teamwork is remarkable.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The public busses are generally double decker.<span>&nbsp; </span>That&rsquo;s all I have to say about that.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I&rsquo;ve never waited so little for the subway.<span>&nbsp; </span>We never waited more than 2 minutes for the next MTR train to arrive and when it did, it would never get too packed with people.<span>&nbsp; </span>Because they run so regularly and often, as a train fills up, people often choose to wait for the next one instead of forcing their way into an already full train. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The world needs more escalators if you ask me.<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> has hot weather and hills- a good recipe for putting escalators to good use. In the hills rising up from the Central area of downtown there are a system of covered escalators called the Mid-Levels, which efficiently shuttle people to and from their hillside high-rise residences and the hip caf&eacute;-culture neighborhood called <st1:place>Soho</st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Mid-Levels system ascends 800 meters up the hill, running downhill in the morning and uphill in the afternoon.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> must be one of the best air conditioned places on earth.<span>&nbsp; </span>We made up a couple of names for our interaction with the cool air:</p>    <ul style="margin-top: 0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal">AC      Poaching &ndash; This is shopping in a store for the single purpose of cooling      down.<span>&nbsp; </span></li><li class="MsoNormal">The <st1:place>Hong       Kong</st1:place> Arctic Wind &ndash; Shops blast cool air onto the sidewalk as      an invitation to come inside for some AC poaching.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the dense retail areas of <st1:city><st1:place>Kowloon</st1:place></st1:city>      the Arctic Wind seemed to lower the overall sidewalk temperature a few      precious degrees.</li></ul>    <p class="MsoNormal"><st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> even seems to have served one of my long standing culinary pet peeves. <span>&nbsp;</span>I have never understood why shrimp are served with the tail attached.<span>&nbsp; </span>You often see a nice grilled or saut&eacute;ed shrimp arrive at your plate with the tail on; obscuring a section of meat and causing the consumer to have to clumsily remove the tail before eating it.<span>&nbsp; </span>So far in <st1:place>Hong  Kong</st1:place>, my shrimps have arrived as whole shrimps, tails removed but hidden meat intact.<span>&nbsp; </span>Again, <st1:place>Hong  Kong</st1:place> makes something more efficient.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place>&rsquo;s efficiency is surely rooted in the money that flows through the city more quickly than almost any city in the world.<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> is quite good at making it easy for people to depart with their money.<span>&nbsp; </span>When it comes in the form of something like the Octopus Card, I&rsquo;m almost happy to see it go.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/78-208901940_2411712078.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/85-211688738_9b94821047.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="142" width="500" /> <br /></p><br class="clear" />
