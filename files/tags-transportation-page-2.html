      <h2><a href="/tuk-tuk" title="Wei vs. The Monsoon">Wei vs. The Monsoon</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on July 18, 2006 - 1:06am</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>It&#39;s safe to say that we have a love/hate relationship with tuk-tuk drivers. They are the most annoying part of being in public in Asia, but they can sometimes offer a good time and a good laugh.&nbsp; When we arrived in Siem Reap Cambodia, we happened to meet a young guy named Wei that ended up being our tuk-tuk driver for three days- and boy did he end up earning his money.</p><p><img onload="show_notes_initially();" width="500" src="/files/includes/images/51-192469632_c730168d84.jpg-v-0.jpg" height="375" class="reflect" /> <br /></p><p>On the third day, we wanted to get off the tourist trail a bit and asked about some ruins called Beng Mealea that are about 2 hours outside of Siem Reap.&nbsp; Wei told that he had never driven a tuk-tuk there, but he would do it for us.&nbsp; We left at 7:30am the next morning.&nbsp;</p><p><img onload="show_notes_initially();" width="500" src="/files/includes/images/53-188708103_0404fea3df.jpg-v-0.jpg" height="375" class="reflect" /></p><p>Wei is a handsome guy and every time we would leave him to do some sight seeing, we&#39;d come back to see a pack of Cambodian girls around his tuk-tuk.&nbsp; He said &quot;all they want is my money&quot;, with a coy smile.&nbsp; His English skills and good nature made us like him too and we felt a little bad to put him through so much.</p><p>The Beng Mealea ruins have only been open to tourists since about 2001 because of land mines.&nbsp; The attraction is that they are mostly untouched- viewed in the condition that nature left them for some 800 years. Like most things in Angkor- an incredible sight.</p><p><img onload="show_notes_initially();" width="500" src="/files/includes/images/70-188708898_3edd752135.jpg-v-0.jpg" height="375" class="reflect" /></p><p>&nbsp;<img onload="show_notes_initially();" width="500" src="/files/includes/images/54-188708189_aca7c3d9de.jpg-v-0.jpg" height="375" class="reflect" /></p><p>Within about one minute of arriving back at the entrance and waking up Wei, it began to rain.&nbsp; It rained very hard for a while and then let up, so we decided to make a move toward Siem Reap.&nbsp; At first, Wei refused a rain coat, perhaps wishfully thinking that it would not be needed. We choose to close ourselves into the tuk-tuk and stay dry. Along the way it rained a bit more, but there was an ominous could hanging on the horizon in the direction of home.&nbsp; It did not look good.</p><p><img onload="show_notes_initially();" width="500" src="/files/includes/images/64-188709143_12a473679c.jpg-v-0.jpg" height="375" class="reflect" /></p><p>About an hour from Siem Reap, Wei decided to put on his poncho and braved some fierce winds and rain without a whimper.&nbsp; I stuck my head out a couple of times and told him it would be OK to take a break.&nbsp; He told me not to worry about it and continued to power on, holding one hand over his eyes to see. It just rained harder and harder and we could only wonder what it must be like on the front of the tuk-tuk.&nbsp; Wei was showing his determination in the face of adversity.</p><p>Just minutes from home, it seemed like a hurricane had come ashore in Siem Reap.&nbsp; I have never seen rain come down harder- it was as if the wind was blowing directly downward onto the ground, splattering the drops into mist upon impact. The Cambodians are used to monsoon rains, but the ones around us were visibly shaken by the force of this rain and wind. &nbsp; </p><p><img onload="show_notes_initially();" width="500" src="/files/includes/images/51-188709276_1aea8f4bc1.jpg-v-0.jpg" height="375" class="reflect" /></p><p>Wei had had enough.&nbsp; He stopped and came around to the open back end of the tuk tuk with a smile- letting us know that he had given up for a while.&nbsp; We laughed until we felt the tuk-tuk convulse a couple of times.&nbsp; It was being shaken by Wei&#39;s shivering. The water had sucked every bit of warmth out of him and he was miserable.&nbsp; He finally climbed into the warm and dry cab of the tuk-tuk with us to recover before finally making it home. &nbsp;</p><p><img onload="show_notes_initially();" width="500" src="/files/includes/images/76-188709224_15cd7f0964.jpg-v-0.jpg" height="375" class="reflect" /></p><p>We had to hand it to him- he tried his best to get through the worst that nature could offer and he did with a smile.&nbsp; We tipped him well and told him to spend it on a party with his friends, where he could tell stories about being his battles with the monsoon. <br /></p><br class="clear" />

  <p>In Chiang Mai, we were offered two options to get to Luang Prabang, Laos. The slow boat would take a couple of days where you sit on a wooden plank for 10 hours per day and can&#39;t lean back on the metal siding because the sun makes it too hot to touch (though we&#39;ve heard varied stories). Or fly in 50 minutes on Lao Airlines. We chose to fly.</p><p>As the plane <i>took off</i> I read our Rough Guide to Southeast Asia&#39;s instructions for getting around by planes. Here&#39;s what I read to Lee:</p><p class="blockquote">Most Western embassies still have travel advisories warning against flying Lao airlines. For some travellers flying Lao Airlines demonstrates bravado, but it&#39;s not really something you want to do unless you absolutely have to.&nbsp;</p><p>We made it just fine.

  Something we would recommend if you want to get outsdide of the cities around Kyoto is the Hozu Gawa River Trip.  You take a train out to the mountains west of Kyoto and take a wodden boat thorugh the mountains for two hours.  For us, the most entertaining part was listening to the reactions of the Japanese girls in front of us.  Good fun and beautiful scenery.  <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/yewNErGGzPI" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="350" width="600"></embed><br />  Of course, this was a bit different than the Shotover Jet River Boats in New Zealand...<br />  <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/g61vQLfLBGc" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="350" width="425"></embed><br class="clear" />

I can't get enough of the bullet trains. It seems to me that the design of the front of the train is a bit gratuitous.  Does it really need to look that cool to function properly, or is it all just looks?  It doesn't matter to me.<br class="clear" />

It is only possible to purchase a JR Pass *outside* of Japan and we planned to buy them in Bangkok. We carefully planned our time in Bangkok to have a weekday for acquiring said pass.  As noted previously, the May Day holiday through a monkey wrench into the plan- all travel agencies were closed.<br /><br /> So, this morning the goal was to take the SkyTrain at rush hour (with our backpacks), find the travel agency somewhere on the busy Silom Rd. that opened at 8:30, get the pass and make our 11am flight to Tokyo, JR Pass in hand.  Delays in getting the pass or traffic could have caused us to miss the flight and not getting the JR would have cost us hundreds of dollars extra in travel. Stakes were high.<br /><br /> Things this morning went hurriedly, sweatily and luckily quite smoothly and here we are with our boarding pass and JR Pass safely in hand, ready for Tokyo.<br /><br /> One quick note:  We were amazed and a bit worried when we tried to board the first train this morning.  The doors opened to reveal people packed in like sardines- you could see that the opening of the doors gave them a little relief.  We looked in there, then at our backpacks, and let that train go.  When the next one came, I remembered watching the <a href="/dispatch/2006/03/20/the-sport-of-rush-hour-train-boarding-in-mumbai-india">men board the train in Mumbai, India</a> and as soon as the doors opened, we pushed in and made room for ourselves, much to the dismay of the man behind Sachi, who pushed her for the rest of the eerily silent ride.  If nothing else, we&#39;re becoming more aware of what it means to give up person space to things done. </p><br class="clear" />

Scrape enough Baht together for bill- 7 nights, 6 breakfasts, 5 dinners for US$280.  We heard they accepted credit cards.<br /><br /> 7:30AM:  Depart for 8AM boat to Phuket in back of pickup truck.<br /><br /> 7:38AM:  Truck proceeds one quarter of the way, stops, turns around, heads back to resort to pick up forgotten passenger- Jack from the UK. Begin frantic drive to catch boat.<br /><br /> 7:58AM: Arrive at boat, both whacked with motion sickness, sweating and feeling green. Banana shaped boat departs into moderate swells and a cloud of diesel exhaust.<br /><br /> 8:35AM: Thanks to the heat and exhaust fumes, Sachi promply tosses breakfast out the starboard side window and returns to seat, refreshed.<br /><br /> 9:15AM: Arrive in Ko Phi Phi, switch to larger, air conditioned boat. Lee contemplates the adventures of his right flip-flop after a mix up last night that resulted in a mismatched pair of footwear.<br /><br /> 9:45AM Jack from the UK sits with us and pours through our Japan guidebook, circling things we should see and do.  We both feel much better than before.<br /><br /> 11AM:  Arrive in Phuket port and try to find a cheaper way into the town center than the standard charge of US$1.25 (50 Baht) per person. No luck.<br /><br /> 11:15AM:  On the way to Phuket Town, remind taxi driver- no we do not want to see your friend&#39;s hotel- no we do not need a new suit.  No stops.<br /><br /> 11:30AM Begin sweltering search for air conditioned lunch and place to chill out in 90(f) heat with everything we have on our backs-on a Saturday-when fewer things are open for lunch. Find an oasis at a coffeeshop called Kopi de Phuket and stay for a while. Mmmm.<br /><br /> 2pm: Try to find taxi to Phuket airport for less than US$10 (400 baht). We give up, it&#39;s hot and they let us walk away when we insist on 350 baht- the taxi drivers are feeling the gas prices here too. Listen to &quot;Hey Jude&quot; (Beatles), &quot;Hang On Sloopy&quot; (The McCoys), &quot;Venus&quot; (Bananarama), &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; (The Archies) via mix cassette tape.  Mmmm.<br /><br /> 3:55PM  Board plane bound for Bangkok with mostly Thai people.  Plane&#39;s speaker system is excruciatingly loud.  Witnessed the fastest ever bi-lingual safety demonstration, performed through no less that 20 blasts of piercing feedback, each followed by attemps to finish the demo and spare everyone&#39;s sanity. Lee wonders why it is that people in front of him on planes insist on putting their seat back with enough force to catapult a pack of peanuts to the back galley.<br /><br /> 5:37PM:  Arrive in Bankok and survey the taxi situation.  A typical dilemma: catch a cab right now for US$12 (negotiated) or wait in a line of 64 people for a metered cab, usually costing US$5-7? We wait- it takes about 15 minutes and costs about US$7.<br /><br /> 6:43PM: Arrive at nicer-than-we-need Asia Hotel in Siam Square for 3 nights at US$41 per night.  Our reserved room type is not available, so we get a free upgrade to Delux. Sweet.<br /><br /> So this ends a pretty typical and low pressure travel day, minus the tossing of breakfasts.  The author is happy that he can now stop referring to himself in the third person. </p><br class="clear" />
