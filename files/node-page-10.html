    <div class="info">By: sachilefever on September 29, 2006 - 5:21am</div>
    <div class="content">
  <p>Since I&#39;ve met Lee, he&#39;s had a dreamy look in his eyes when he describes cold places above the Arctic Circle. Our overnight train leaves for Rovaniemi, a town 6 miles from the Arctic Circle, in a few hours and we&#39;re both excited to head north. However, we&#39;re not sure what we will do after we cross it. Readily available summer transportation has slowed its frequency at this time of year, and some ferries and busses may not be running at all in the Northern wilderness of Finland and Norway.&nbsp;</p><p>We are just going to arrive, head to the tourist office and see what lodges or cottages we can get to and talk to local folks from there. We might be heading to the fjords and Lofoten Islands of Northern Norway, or we might be heading right back to Helsinki. Either way, we&#39;ll see some reindeer, the <a href="http://www.santaclaus.fi/?deptid=8044">official Santa</a> and soon-to-be-frozen lakes along the way.&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="content">
    <p class="MsoNormal">It&rsquo;s quite apparent that the Russians have mixed feelings about <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> (depending on where you ask) and after a few days there I think we feel the same. It was at once harsh and smooth, rude and friendly, ugly and beautiful.<span>&nbsp; </span>Overall though, I&rsquo;d say it was better than I expected.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/105-252293946_b2e37f4a21.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Of course we had friends in the city that showed us around their neighborhoods and homes, which was a perfect introduction to the city. The warmth of the personal connection with people in <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> made us feel at home.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, once we ventured out on our own, other sides of the city appeared</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/95-252293749_5a1db75ef7.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Suddenly I found myself in center of the former Communist stronghold, surrounded by reminders of the Bolshevik Revolution, the <st1:country-region><st1:place>USSR</st1:place></st1:country-region> and Communism.<span>&nbsp; </span>I saw the Kremlin-adjacent apartments where Stalin&rsquo;s cronies were arrested and shot.<span>&nbsp; </span>I ate at places where people once stood in line for bread.<span>&nbsp; </span>All the things I learned about the Russians and Communism were right there before me and I could feel the power.<span>&nbsp; </span>In <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> the grandeur of the buildings are awe-inspiring &ndash; monuments to a government that controlled 1/6<sup>th</sup> of the earth&rsquo;s surface and had plans for world domination.<span>&nbsp; </span>This was the place, right under my feet.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/95-252294291_a25f28aa21.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">And it is beautiful.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tiananmen has nothing on <st1:place>Red Square</st1:place>. The parks, rivers and thoroughfares are quite delightful, especially on a nice day. <span>&nbsp;</span>I had no idea that <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> was covered in parks. The legendary Metro subway system is showing its age, but still maintains a world class level of elegance and efficiency.<span>&nbsp; </span>The street food is always-on and yummy. The drab and cold <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> I expected was a distant vision, but some of what I had heard was confirmed.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">It is said that <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> is the &ldquo;dictator&rdquo; and <st1:city><st1:place>St. Petersburg</st1:place></st1:city> is the &ldquo;artist&rdquo; and having visited both, it is obvious why.<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> is not a warm and fuzzy sort of place for the visitor.<span>&nbsp; </span>Customer service is very short and cold, there is no English anywhere and downtown sometimes seems covered in police. The people you encounter appear quite gloomy with very few smiles.

  <p>It&#39;s clear that in the short trip from Russia to Finland, we have entered a different world. Being hungry right off the train, we quickly found a cafe close to the station and walked in.&nbsp; We are used to struggling through menus in other languages and this one was in Finnish.&nbsp; However, what happened next did not happen for the last few months - a smiling gentleman approached us and said, in a slight Scandanavian accent&nbsp; &quot;would you like me to translate for you?&quot;&nbsp; Whahhh?&nbsp; It was true - we are now in a different and more familiar world.&nbsp;</p><p>The issue right now, however, is exactly which part of this world we&#39;ll see. Right now we have a place to stay tonight in Helsinki and that is the full extent of our future plans.&nbsp; Before us lies the whole of Europe and where we&#39;ll go next depends on which hour you ask us.&nbsp; Currently, we&#39;re considering at trip to Finnish Lapland - inside the Artic Circle. From there, maybe Sweden and/or Estonia and Latvia.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />

  <p>From the moment we arrived in Yekaterinburg, Russia, I had the song &quot;<a href="http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Modest-Mouse/The-Cold-Part.html">The Cold Part</a>&quot; by Modest Mouse playing in my head, which is  a dark and desolate song that sings &quot;so long to this cold, cold part of the world&quot;.

We stayed with a local named Eleana for two nights in former Communist housing blocks.  She was nice, but was caring for a friend who was sick at the time and we have both become ill after staying with her. The housing was warm on the inside, scary on the outside. </p>  <p>Yakaterinburg is famous for the deaths of the last czarist family in Russia, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanovs">Romanovs</a>, who were killed in a cellar in the city by the Communist Revolutionaries as a symbol of the end of their imperial rule. A sad and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/133725.stm">controversial story</a>.</p>  <p>Yekaterineburg is at the imaginary border between Asia (and Siberia) and Europe, so the song even fit as we left...</p>  <p><i>so long to this cold, cold part of the world</i></p><br class="clear" />

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Given the opportunity, we will choose to hang out with the locals and in nearly every instance.<span>&nbsp; </span>The vast majority of the time, it has been a rewarding and interesting experience.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, on the Trans-Siberian Railway we&rsquo;ve learned that there are Russian locals that you don&rsquo;t necessarily want to &ldquo;experience&rdquo; for 2 days on a train.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Peer pressure is an issue on the Trans-Siberian train with consistent reminders from other travelers that this is the &ldquo;vodka train&rdquo; and you must drink Russian vodka.<span>&nbsp; </span>This pressure is lost on the Russian locals though as they need no pressure whatsoever to drink on a train.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is a requirement for them and when mixing with foreign travelers the requirement is shared by all.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">So we found ourselves in the dining car on the second night of a 48 hour journey from Irkustk to Ekaterineburg.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Between Slava, the gigantic ex-Russian Army captain with bullet wounds and Victor, the pudgy Belushi-esque ex-Mafia family man, we had our hands full.<span>&nbsp; </span>While our English friend Paul was busy being pressured by Slava into drinking more vodka than he wanted, I got a dose of vodka with Victor and his fellow Russian friends, who seemed to be complete blockheads.<span>&nbsp; </span>We drank more, became friends, toasted to health, arm wrestled and looking back I can say that I have never witnessed so many scars on so many people.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think these guys have had a hard life.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">For some reason I accepted Victor&rsquo;s invitation for me and Sachi to come to his room and drink more vodka. Not only did this end up with me losing a few hours of memory, but it caused Sachi to end up babysitting Victor&rsquo;s Coke-spewing 4 year old child &ldquo;Sergei&rdquo; for over an hour.<span>&nbsp; </span>She was not happy and I had no idea why.<span>&nbsp; </span>What I did remember was Victor telling me at some point in the night that the wolf tattoo on his arm was from his 3 year prison term.<span>&nbsp; </span>Apparently had &ldquo;only killed one person&rdquo; while in the Russian mafia.<span>&nbsp; </span>Had I had my wits about me, I may have escaped at that point, but I didn&rsquo;t.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The next day I awoke to a hangover, an upset wife and a half-drunk Russian ex-con banging on the door at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9AM</st1:time> with a 2 liter beer in his hand.<span>&nbsp; </span>We were still friends and he was clearly doing me a favor by bring over the beer. <span>&nbsp;</span>He started with the old Russian saying &ldquo;A good friend drinks vodka with you yesterday, a great friend drinks vodka with you today!&rdquo; as if I might appreciate the classical nature of the moment.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>I would have none of it, despite him barging in, pouring a glass, spilling it on the floor and insisting I drink no less than 15 times. Of course Sachi was now noticing that she would now clean up after both father and son in our compartment. I was at a loss for more ways to say &ldquo;nyet&rdquo; &ndash; nothing seemed to work. Sachi would later say that when he came in she wanted to kick him in the face.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course, I was implicit in this frustration. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Later Victor hooked back up with the Blockheads and they formed a roaming band of drunk-in-the-morning Russian annoyances.<span>&nbsp; </span>They went from one end of the train to the other, peer-pressuring everyone from the night before to drink with them.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of them even forced his way into the compartment of understandably shaken American and Canadian girls.<span>&nbsp; </span>He would later be quite accurately called a stalker.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">This band of drunks eventually caused the revelers from the night before to close their doors and hide out for the majority of the morning.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many, including Sachi and I ignored knocks at our doors.<span>&nbsp; </span>The foreigners on the train tried to memorize compartment numbers so we could visit one another without keeping a door open.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was talk of passwords being used.<span>&nbsp; </span>We were held hostage by the locals.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">By about <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1pm</st1:time> the drunk Russians had passed out &ndash; we could hear Victor snoring through the compartment walls and from that point the foreigners on the train began to appear like refugees after a bombing campaign.<span>&nbsp; </span>Shaken, annoyed and hungover, we stuck together and decided that drinking with the locals is fun, but sharing 2 days on a train with the same people is another story all together.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Watch the <a href="/47/vodka_train">Video Here</a>. <br /></p>  <br class="clear" />

  <p>To look at Lake Baikal doesn&#39;t do it justice - it is just a big lake in a beautiful and peaceful setting.
