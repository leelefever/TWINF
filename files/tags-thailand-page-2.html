However, what we&rsquo;ve found is that we&rsquo;d prefer a place that is not so developed with resorts and shopping malls. Railay Beach West was a good example.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was a stretch of beach that had one resort on top of another.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was almost impossible to get a feel for </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Railey</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Beach</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"> outside of how the resorts think you want to be treated.<span>&nbsp; </span>As it turns out, we don&rsquo;t need the high-end resort treatment.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was busy, with kids running around, competition for beach chairs and higher-than-needed room rates.<span>&nbsp; </span>We thought it was great at the time, and it was superb, but we now have the advantage of hindsight and can feel confident that we will not go back. As the Frenchman said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m in Thailand at all.&rdquo; (Note: Railay does have an east side that is more laid back and popular among rock-climbers, but lacks a beach)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/48-135831286_f1d47985e1.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="209" width="500" /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"><o:p> <br /></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">And so our rite of passage continues.

Usually they cost between $5-7US per day, not including gas.  Filling a motorbike up costs about $2US.<br /><br /> Anyway, one thing we&#39;ve learned is that you never know what you&#39;re going to get, so give the bike a good once-over before striking out into the yonder for a two-wheeled adventure.  We should have done that yesterday when we picked our Honda Dream.<br /><br /> The island of Ko Lanta Yai has an elongated north/south shape, with the main roads forming a figure eight. It is about 30 kms long and 6 wide.<br /><br /> As we got on the bike, all was well, though it seemed a little loose on the turns, so I was careful not to push it too hard.  Sachi rides double with me. We decided to traverse all 30kms of the east coast, about one half of which is dirt road.<br /><br /> As we got on the dirt road at the north eastern side of the figure 8, I thought to myself &quot;Well it would suck to break down here... There&#39;s no one around, its in the heat of the day, we only have sips of water and we don&#39;t speak Thai.&quot;<br /><br /> It was at about that moment that the looseness I felt before turned into all out squirreliness, with the back tire feeling like it was sliding around in mud.  Sure enough, the back tire was completely flat and at the furthest point we could be from where we started.<br /><br /> Being at least 7kms from any place that might be able to help us, we jumped on the moped and rode the flat tire all the way up that dirt road at about 5kph, with the tire struggling to remain intact all the way. The locals we did see could only shake their head and point forward as if to say &quot;keep on going, farangs, I can&#39;t help, sorry.&quot;<br /><br /> Eventually we made it back to the paved road, which was still a good 20kms from the resort- and we still had a flat tire.  Our next goal was to find some sort of service station that could help. In the meantime I could picture us creeping down the side road on the metal rim, with the tire having been shredded to pieces, sparks flying everywhere and each person we meet pointing further down the road, farangs.<br /><br /> Then, only 1-2kms from the dirt road, an oasis appeared on the horizon.  It was none other than a full service, fully certified, Honda motorbike service center and showroom. We pulled up, pointed to the tire, they immediately jumped into action, replaced the inner tube, charged us $2.50US (yes, you read that price correctly), and we were on our way in about 20 minutes.  We could only smile and shake our heads at how easily we averted what could have been a time consuming, possibly dangerous and certainly annoying experience.<br /><br /> For as long as we&#39;re in Ko Lanta, that Honda Dream is going to be our motorbike.  We know for sure that it has a brand new back inner tube, and handles adversity like a champ.  Plus, if something goes wrong, we know where to go. </p><br class="clear" />

  <p class="MsoNormal">We shouldn&rsquo;t have eaten breakfast. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal">I wondered how it would play out&hellip;do we cook and then eat each dish? Or cook them all and then sit down to a feast for lunch? It turned out to be the former and each dish turned out to be a full-sized plate/bowl.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">But first, getting there was to be more of a journey than we expected. After waiting 30 minutes on the East <st1:place><st1:placetype>beach</st1:placetype>  of <st1:placename>Railay</st1:placename></st1:place> for more passengers, our long tail boat taxi finally pulled its anchor for Ao Nammao (just around a big karst formation.) It was low tide so we slipped and slid a good 80 meters to the boat in the sandy muck.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/46-132303031_6e72e80c35.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">On the other side was more muck where our slippers were almost lost in the sticky mud. Our teacher, Pin, met us at the dock and off we rode to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Siam</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Cuisine</st1:placename>  <st1:placename>Thai</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Cookery</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>School</st1:placetype></st1:place> (<a href="mailto:krabisiamcuisine@yahoo.com">krabisiamcuisine@yahoo.com</a>).</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/45-132303229_1bb4f4fe3d.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Phad thai, spring rolls, coconut milk soup, chicken with cashews and ginger, noodle salad&hellip;the highlight for me was pounding red curry paste from scratch with a mortar and pestle. </p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/50-132304015_8567c51e81.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p class="MsoNormal">We learned that each dish takes either 2 tablespoons of oyster sauce or 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, or both, and it always requires two teaspoons of sugar. We were told we were aiming for a &ldquo;sweet, sour and fragrant&rdquo; touch. In every dish, Pin would point at a leaf or vegetable and smile, &ldquo;This makes it smell good.&rdquo; Lee was surprised that such few and simple ingredients made for such flavorful dishes. This is Tom Ka soup...</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/55-132303739_2dc65673b7.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Oh, and for all of you who like to cook or would like to try cooking thai noodles&hellip;Phad thai has NO KETCHUP. Lee and I always wondered if American Thai restaurants and recipes were not following an authentic style by including ketchup. We now know that the basic sauce is just garlic, oyster sauce, fish sauce and yup&hellip;two teaspoons of sugar.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/50-132304271_ca0a981d69.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p class="MsoNormal">We realized after the first full plate of phad thai and then 3 spring rolls per person that we should only be sampling these dishes&hellip;it was only 10:30am.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/52-132303379_bb83b671e5.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="500" width="375" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">The helper girls laughed at me for having little or no hot spice in my dishes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pin laughed at herself for being half of Lee&rsquo;s size. I think she gets a kick out of draping tall westerners in aprons especially when she has to reach above her head to tie the strings around their waists. <span>&nbsp;</span>We had a great time and recommend dong something similar. We cooked seven dishes (enough to take home for dinner) and a ride back to the long tail water taxi beach all for about USD$30 per person.

  <p>&nbsp;The reason to go to Railay Beach is the scenery and the nice beach.&nbsp; The locale itself is built up with resorts that are nice, but make for a busy environment.&nbsp; Ton Sai is just a kilometer away and is more of a low-key backpacker place- called &quot;the peasant beach&quot; by one resident we met. The same is true for the east side of Railay Beach, which has a mud beach.&nbsp; Lots of people come for the excellent rock climbing too. </p><p>Now that we&#39;re in Ko Lanta, here&#39;s a look back at some of the scenes from Railay Beach...</p><p>&nbsp;Most unforgettable were the sunsets.&nbsp; The sky would seem to be on fire sometimes.</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/44-130041210_76e4f6183f.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/46-131263560_211a3a24d1.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>These clounds aren&#39;t exactly on fire, but look pretty magestic, I think.</p><p>&nbsp;<br /><img src="/files/includes/images/45-132304622_a29deec19e.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>The longtail boat is the only way to get to Railay Beach.<br /><img src="/files/includes/images/55-132304451_6cb8f5e774.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;Once you&#39;re there, though, you can explore on foot and by sea kayak, which is highly recommended. No cave for Sachi.<br /></p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/46-132304815_4558454658.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;I think we&#39;re both happy that we went to Railay beach, but I don&#39;t think it would make it onto the agenda the next time around.&nbsp; We&#39;d prefer the more traditional, laid back, Ko Lanta style of Thailand. </p><br class="clear" />

  <p>Our friend Tanya Mau, who has spent a lot of time in Thailand, contacted us recently in email and said this &quot;YOU MUST TRY AND VISIT THE SONGKRAN FESTIVAL (water festival for the Thai New Year) this week.&quot;&nbsp; So we were sure to heed her advice.</p><p>So, we struck out on the scooter yesterday not knowing what to expect.&nbsp; Within about 2 minutes of leaving the resort, we were both completely soaked, head to toe, including the scooter.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/50-128242830_e7e1327797.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.1_Songkran%E2%80%99s_Day">Songkran Day</a> is the Thai New Years celebration that has roots in using water as a symbol of cleansing for the new year.&nbsp; From our prespective, Songkran is the National Water Fight Day.&nbsp; All along every road, there are people waiting with huge tubs of water, ready to drench anyone who comes by. This makes the normal 40kph road a wet, splashing and noisy parking lot that is more like a party than a road. </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/55-128241279_a3d1f89d48.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;It makes for an incredibly fun day and a chance to interact with the locals who love nothing more than to drench a Farang (white foreigner).&nbsp; Some approaching vehicles would see us and rally the troops to cries of &quot;FARANG! FARANG! FARANG!&quot;&nbsp; We were targets, willingly. Everyone, young, old, male, female, got into the action and no one was spared.&nbsp; All in good clean fun.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-128241201_f60841ecca.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Of course, we had our own defense...</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/48-128241338_a23d68eaa1.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;And I sprang to action when the time came...</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/48-128241528_e11809586f.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;But found that we were slightly over-powered...</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/56-128241606_e4e84c9ee1.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>I&#39;ve got to hand it to some of the Songkran innovators, who get giant blocks of ice and put them into the water barrels, making ice cold water that is a startling surprise.&nbsp; We&#39;re both thankful to have been a part of the celebration- and that we have a Pentax Option WP- a waterproof camera- without which these pictures would not be possible. <br class="clear" />

	Folks, in what is true to our style of travel, we've arrived in Southern Thailand with no specific plans.  The problem is an overwhelming number of options.<br /><br />
So, we figure this might be a good time to call on you, dear TwinF readers.  We're hoping that you can help us figure out locations and accomodations for the next couple of weeks. We're trying to find a place to take a vacation from travel- we need a place to relax and do very little.<br /><br />
You can help by Adding a New Travel Experience to this site, leaving a comment on this entry or emailing us using the Contact Us tab above.<br /><br />
If you're a blogger, it would be an interesting experiment if you could point your readers to this entry to see if the blog world has input.<br /><br />
What are your favorite places in Southern Thailand?
