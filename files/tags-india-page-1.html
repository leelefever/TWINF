  <p>India's Golden Triangle consists of 3 basic cities: Delhi, Agra and Jaipur.&nbsp; Each place has their won sights and cultures and the triangle is one of the most traveled tourist routes in India.&nbsp; We went by driver (4 days at $220US).&nbsp; </p><p>Like a lot of the trip, I end up being more interested in the random and fleeting things you see on the way to a sight than the sight itself.&nbsp; here are a few...</p><p>Once we entered Rajasthan, where Jaipur is, we started seeing lots of camels.&nbsp;Rajasthan is very arid and desert, especially since the drought that started in 1997.&nbsp;Most camels &quot;ships of the desert&quot;&nbsp;were strapped to carts and made me feel like we had gone back in time.</p><p>Here is one with a dog on top and an another dog in the shadow.</p><p><img height="375" src="/files/includes/images/55-118677229_0da5e16860.jpg-v-0.jpg" width="500" onload="show_notes_initially()" /></p><p>I don't think I had ever seen baby camels...</p><p><img height="375" src="/files/includes/images/56-118675452_6e695fe3e9.jpg-v-0.jpg" width="500" onload="show_notes_initially()" /></p><p>Aside from the camels the Indians have all sorts of interesting vehicles, including the &quot;jugad&quot;, which is put together with spare parts and is illegal.&nbsp; I remember the name because &quot;<em>jugad to put it together yourself, man</em>.&quot;</p><p><img height="375" src="/files/includes/images/51-118675451_4b0b9d6540.jpg-v-0.jpg" width="500" onload="show_notes_initially()" /></p><p>The trucks are much like Sri Lanka, with each having a lot of artful color and messages to other drivers.&nbsp;Most do not have turn signals and few have working rearview mirrors.&nbsp; &quot;Horn Please&quot; means to blow your horn when you pass and &quot;Wait for Side&quot; means wait for a hand wave from the driver.</p><p><img height="375" src="/files/includes/images/39-118679033_f8af58d44b.jpg-v-0.jpg" width="500" onload="show_notes_initially()" /></p><p>This is a random girl watch us go by...</p><p><img height="375" src="/files/includes/images/19-118677231_8f0bcb1fb1.jpg-v-0.jpg" width="500" onload="show_notes_initially()" /></p><p>The road from Agra to Jaipur is terrible now, due to construction, but should be better in 2008.&nbsp; </p><br class="clear" />

We took some Immodium and hoped for the best for the 4 hour journey from Jaipur.<br /><br />Since the ride, I've been better, but Sachi, not so much. She isn't deathly ill, but goes to the bathroom every hour or so and sometimes runs a fever. She's been in bed since yesterday and I've spent a good portion of my time there too.<br /><br />Fortunately, the hotel (Nirula's in Connaught Place) is nice and has cable TV, and a couple of English channels, including HBO (edited and with commercials). We've seen commercials for a car called a Xeta approximately 2000 times. Many commercials seem to speak Hinglish - Hindi and English. One, for &quot;Anti-aging&quot; motor oil has a catchy jingle at the end that, the best I can tell sings &quot;Magic Anti-Aging...Jah Boo-jah Boo&quot;.<br /><br />There are a few Indian music video channels that seem to play the same 4 songs over and over (much like home). Apparently synchronized dancing is a required element of any Indian video. That, and a duet with a hot female with an extremely high voice that may or may not be the actual singer.<br /><br />The movies have been a mixed bag, but when there's no choice and inaction is a requirement, Problem Child 2 or Anaconda can pass the time quite nicely. We were excited to catch Shaun of the Dead last night, followed up by Ray and Men in Black. I fell asleep to Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses, which I wish I could have Tivo'd. Today we saw Indentity with John Cusack and the kid movie Matilda.<br /><br />It's looking like we may hang out here for a couple of days to recover fully. Maybe we'll pick up a little Hindi or learn a few dance moves, to be practiced on the way to the bathroom. </p><br class="clear" />

It is a man and boy, performing a Rajasthani folk dance, dressed in the traditional garb.<br /><br />Their business is posing for pictures in exchange for a tip.<br /><br />It's interesting to see, but I don't necessarily think it's something that makes me feel like I'm experiencing an authentic part of Indian culture. Being so bombarded with all things touristy, I get a bad taste in my mouth about the cheapening nature of goods and performances designed for the tourist audience. Over time, it is easy to start feeling that anything &quot;for tourists&quot; is inauthentic and not interesting to me. Lately I wonder if I'm missing something because I've become skeptical or even cynical about what represents an authentic article vs. another well dressed scheme to help tourists depart with their money.<br /><br />The more places we go, the easier it gets to seperate the wheat from the chaff. Doing the tourist things is an inevitable and important part of the trip, but a little skepticism can be healthy, so long as it doesn't become complete disenchantment.<br /><br />As an alternative, we seek out things like the Mumbai train station, which is as real as it gets. Also we saw the Taj Mahal today and it is surely the authentic article. Live and learn I suppose, live and learn. </p><br class="clear" />

Despite multiple email and phone confirmations, we found out at 5pm that we had no room reserved for tonight. I asked the driver this morning about the hotel and found it was impossible to communicate with him (again, despite confirming an English speaking driver). So, being fed up, we cancelled the whole trip and started over from square one.<br /><br />We found a hotel and booked a new driver through a gov't tourist office within an hour. The guy above was a huge and honest help and we are now set for the next few days.<br /><br />Oh and despite everything, we changed our flight to have an extra week in India (now leaving April 2nd). We're gluttons for punishment I guess.<br /><br />Today reminded us of two things: how luxurious it was to stay with Dina in Mumbai and yes Sandra, where the hell is Mervyn when you need him? </p><br class="clear" />

  <p>While we have some wi-fi love, we're posting some pics that we've taken in Mumbai.&nbsp; They may not be of the sights, but hopefully they tell a story on their own.</p><p>&nbsp;This is in a fishing village near the Carter Roadbeach, Mumbai called Khar.&nbsp;&nbsp; They dry fish in the village and&nbsp; you can smell it&nbsp; all over the Bandra area.</p><p><img width="500" height="375" onload="show_notes_initially()" src="/files/includes/images/37-115730751_36da334df8.jpg-v-0.jpg" /> <br /></p><p>Like Sri Lanka, almost all outdoor work is done in bare feet for slipppers (flip flops).&nbsp; This is a couple of jackhammer operators in slippers, which seems a bit risky to me. Roadwork is happening everywhere in Mumbai.<br /></p><p>&nbsp;<img width="500" height="375" onload="show_notes_initially()" src="/files/includes/images/50-115731586_28485572a6.jpg-v-0.jpg" /></p><p>&nbsp;When stopping at intersection, people often come and tap on the window and often put their hand to their mouth.&nbsp; It's very sad and hard to watch, sitting there in our air conditioned car.&nbsp; I think a lot about this little girl. The poverty in Mumbai is quite overwhelming.</p><p>&nbsp;<img width="500" height="375" onload="show_notes_initially()" src="/files/includes/images/19-115337253_b374847817.jpg-v-0.jpg" /></p><p>&nbsp;Of course, Mumbai has beauty in a number of ways.&nbsp; The people have all been wonderful, very kind and we have never once felt unsafe.&nbsp; Despite poverty, they have a dignity about themthat is hard to describe. </p><p>&nbsp;<img width="500" height="375" onload="show_notes_initially()" src="/files/includes/images/36-115337488_29fbbf46cc.jpg-v-0.jpg" /></p><p>More than anything, we will remember the hospitality of <a href="http://www.dinamehta.com/">Dina Mehta</a>, who has opened her heart and her city to us in so many ways.&nbsp; Dina, I hope we can return the favor in Seattle.</p><p>&nbsp;<img width="375" height="500" onload="show_notes_initially()" src="/files/includes/images/55-115336734_1114cac657.jpg-v-0.jpg" /></p><br class="clear" />

They have an excellent safety record based on train crashes, but 10-15 people per day die on the tracks.   As Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_railways">describes</a>:&nbsp;  </p><p><span class="blockquote">Mumbai's suburban railway is the densest route in the world. It is approximately a little more than 50,000 passengers per kilometer, transporting 65 lakh (6.5 million) commuters daily. This has resulted in severe overloading in the trains which carry 5000 commuters per 9 car train which are designed to carry less than a third of that amount. The density of passengers in peak hours is as high as 15 people per sq metre.</span>  </p><p>We went to the busy Dadar station today at rush hour to watch the spectacle, which should not be missed in any visit to Mumbai.  The event can best be described as a sport for the men.  It takes speed, agility, strength, perseverance and concentration.  </p><p>&nbsp;<img width="500" height="375" onload="show_notes_initially()" src="/files/includes/images/51-115338034_da663fcdc9.jpg-v-0.jpg" /></p><p>As the train approaches the station, the men let out a chorus of yells as they gather on the platform.  As the train speeds by as it slows, a few jump into the open doors as the crowds push closer to the edge. The men clearly revel in the competition among their peers.  </p><p>&nbsp;<img width="500" height="375" onload="show_notes_initially()" src="/files/includes/images/53-115338222_34d34711b5.jpg-v-0.jpg" /></p><p>When it comes to a stop, it turns into a civilized wrestling match with each man struggling to find some type of toe hold inside the train- some way to pry himself into the car before it leaves.  The men are packed together so closely I wonder how they can breathe.  </p><p>&nbsp;<img width="500" height="375" onload="show_notes_initially()" src="/files/includes/images/47-115338484_6518e0ff86.jpg-v-0.jpg" /></p><p>With more men than room, the train begins to move and the lucky ones fight tooth and nail to find some way to hold onto the train as it leaves, each with a confident smile, knowing he had won. Some are left to fight for another train. </p><p>Incredibly, we saw just one station of many, where the scene will be repeated until the train achieves a level of density that no mere mortal can handle.  Athletes indeed. </p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="content">

  <p>I said earlier that India is supposed to be one of the hardeest places to travel.&nbsp; In meeting up with <a href="http://dinamehta.com/">Dina Mehta</a> and her husband Hemant, it has been anything but hard.</p><p>&nbsp;<img height="375" src="/files/includes/images/55-114515115_45b7853162.jpg-v-0.jpg" width="500" onload="show_notes_initially()" /></p><p>I know Dina through the blog world - we've been reading each others blogs for a couple of years, but never really had much contact otherwise.&nbsp; I contacted her when were started planning the trip and we feel very fortunate to spend our time here with such kind, interesting and fun&nbsp; people here in Mumbai. Both Dina and Hemant have lived in Mumbai all their lives and the city is surely a different place with them as our guides. Their hospitality has been wonderful. This is our walk on the Bandra Bandstand - one of the upmarket places to be.</p><p><img height="139" src="/files/includes/images/36-114619222_3d44a5697b.jpg-v-0.jpg" width="500" onload="show_notes_initially()" /></p><p>You almost never hear anyone describe Mumbai without the phrase &quot;bursting at the seams&quot;.&nbsp; It is one of the world's great cities with about 15 million people.&nbsp; The city grew from 4 million to 15 million since 1947, after India acheived independence from England. The population is expected to grow to 28 million in 2020.&nbsp; The reason it is bursting at the seams is it's geography and lack of infrastructure.</p><p>&nbsp;<img height="500" src="/files/includes/images/37-114614312_a7f5ba1c4a.jpg-v-0.jpg" width="375" onload="show_notes_initially()" /></p><p>There isn't a lot for the tourist to do here, so we're exploring daily life with Dina and learning about all things Mumbai. It is an incredible places to be at this stage in the city's history.&nbsp; </p><p>Here are a couple of scenes from everyday life...</p><p>&nbsp;These kids were playing &quot;gully cricket&quot; outside of here flat.&nbsp; They play every Sunday.&nbsp; Cricket is <strike>national sport</strike> the most popular sport, but field hockey is the national sport.</p><p>&nbsp;<img height="375" src="/files/includes/images/46-114515212_b0922af9fc.jpg-v-0.jpg" width="500" onload="show_notes_initially()" /></p><p>&nbsp;Both here and Sri Lanka, it is quite normal to see men holding hands or with their arms around one another. It is a sign of friendship and had no homosexual connotations whatsoever.&nbsp; This guy happened to look back, just as I snapped the shot:</p><p><img height="375" src="/files/includes/images/44-114614766_be863db34f.jpg-v-0.jpg" width="500" onload="show_notes_initially()" /> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;Today it's off the see the crush at the train station, among other things.<br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />
