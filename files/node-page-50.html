<p>Yesterday I got the first design drafts for the new TwinF site from the Raincity guys and they looked good.  I really have a lot of respect for designers who have to work on limited input to create something unique.  </p><p>The first designs were good, but there were elements of each that I did and didn't like.  So, with the help of <a href="http://www.theusefularts.com/">Anthony</a> (a gifted designer himself) we created what I call a Frankenstein version of the design that is ugly (because it crosses two designs) but represents the elements I think are important.</p><p align="baseline">It's so exciting to see it coming together.  Here's a small bit of the design that I liked...</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/47-image-view-195.jpg" /></p><p /><br class="clear" />

<p>In the next few weeks, this site is going to go through a makeover.  The basic functionality will remain, but the look of the site will change significantly by the end of September. </p><p>I'm totally excited about the new design and should see three mock-ups of design ideas this coming week and from there we'll choose one and get it rolling.  The guys at <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com/">Rain City Studios</a> are helping with the design.</p><p>Right now, this site is using a &quot;theme&quot; provided via it's platform, so there are a bunch of sites out there with the same look and feel.  We want to be unique, hence the new design.</p><p>Then, once the new design is in-place, we'll start doing a little more &quot;marketing&quot; which basically means asking our friends to put the word out and see if the Internet is interested. </p><p>Lots of fun stuff coming in the next month.

  <p>It's time for <a href="http://www.rei.com/">REI's</a> Labor Day sale and you know that that means?  Time to look at getting prepared for the trip.  It's 15 weeks from our departure day of December 11th, so we gotta get some things checked off the list.</p><p>Of course, with <a href="/node/137">the monetorium</a> in full swing, we need to take advantage of the sale.  We're looking at stuff like:</p><p>* Shoes and Sandals</p><p>* Backpacks<br /><br />* Pack Towels</p><p>* Light and quick-drying Clothes</p><p>* First Aid Supplies</p><p>* Insect Repellent</p><p>* Rain Jacket</p><p>* Containers for things like pills</p><p>*Stuff Sacks</p><p>... and all sorts of small miscellany.  It's funny to me to think about how much these things will get used.  I mean, so much of what we bring is going to be with us on a day-to-day basis.  We've considered getting extras of some things and sending a care package to ourselves at soe point.</p><p>Lastly I want to thank the folks that have been contributing, it's so awesome to hear furst-hand perspectives on places like <a href="/node/189">Laos</a> and <a href="/node/192">Cambodia</a>, especially from old friends.  I'm talkin to you JJ and Casey- you guys are doing exactly what we need!</p><p></p><br class="clear" />

  <p>We've been making plans to get certified for Scuba here in the Seattle area before the trip.  It's turned into a big scheduling nightmare as we've had to reschedule like 4 times.  We originally hoped to do it in the bright and sunny days of this month, but now it looks like it'll be October.</p><p>We'll do 2 days of open water classes in the Puget Sound, where the water temperature is about 48 degrees.  brrrrrr.  I'm pretty stoked about the whole thing, but Sachiko...not so much. She's interested, but has a little trepidation about the whole thing.  I do too, to be honest.</p><p>I'm hoping we'll both get certified and be able to see the underwater world on the trip too.  If not, it won't be a huge deal- snorkeling is fun too.</p><p></p><br class="clear" />

  I've been follow Andy at <a href="http://www.hobotraveler.com/">HoboTraveller.com</a>  What impresses me about Andy (aside from him traveling for 8 years) is that he goes where the action is and is trying hard to go and document history using his blog, as it happens.  He was <a href="http://www.hobotraveler.com/2005/08/searched-by-israel-paranoia.html">recently in Isreal</a> for the gaza pull-out and is now <a href="http://www.hobotraveler.com/2005/08/your-problem-is-not-high-priority.html">trying really hard</a> to get to Niger to document the famine there.<p>I have a lot of respect for that kind of travel.  Being green ourselves, I don't think we'll be looking for human suffering and newsworthy events this time around.  But, I could see myself, at some point in the future, being drawn to places on the globe where history is happening and hoping to document it in my own way.  </p><p>For now though, I'd be scared to roll into Niger during a famine.</p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="content">
  <p>Well, more big news on the planning front- our date of departure has been set.  Just recently, we were planning to start the trip by driving across the country.  You see, we need to get to North Carolina for the holidays and driving seemed like a good way to start the trip. But, rental cars would cost close to $1000 for the time we'd like to take, not counting gas and lodging.</p><p>At the same time, I had been wanting to go to New York on the way over to see some clients and visit the city.  So, we looked into it and found tickets direct from Seattle to New York City for $120pp one way on Song Airlines.  You can't beat getting across the country for that.</p><p><b>So, final plans are made and our departure date for the trip will be December 11th.</b>  We'll go to New York until the 14th and then catch a train down to North Carolina, where we'll borrow a family vehicle (hopefully) and visit friends in the south for a while before Christman.</p><p>Then, we leave NC on the 30th for Hawaii thorugh New Years- and then the trip REALLY begins on January 6th.  Damn thats a lot of planning- but its so fun!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
