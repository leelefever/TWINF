    <div class="info">By: <a href="/profile/leelefever" title="View user profile.">leelefever</a> on May 29, 2006 - 1:42am</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>Being that we&#39;re leaving from Tokyo, we decided to come back to experience three specific things that we didn&#39;t get to do on our first visit to the city.&nbsp;</p><p>First, is what are called the cos-play-zoku, or costume play gang, that gather in Harajuku&#39;s Jingu-bashi in outlandish costumes.&nbsp; They like having the attention for the most part, but you get the feeling that they aren&#39;t doing it to impress the tourists that photograph them.&nbsp; They stick together and take lots of photos of one another too.&nbsp; A weird and fun experience that we recommend highly.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/52-154654144_212f0b7d3f.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;I didn&#39;t smell anything bad.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/73-154654077_5b411ce819.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;You rarely see any young Japanese person without a mobile phone, even if they are wearing a little bo peep outfit.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/77-154653989_f9eb2740fa.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;This is just plain scary and reminds me of Bangkok.<br /></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-154653921_0d2cc9d3bc.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>Next on the list was seeing the Shibuya crosswalk on a busy day. It is the busiest crosswalk in the world.&nbsp; Amazing.</p><p>&nbsp;This is before:<br /></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/64-155424645_9fe7038848.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;and after:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/70-155424719_d996d06f62.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Lastly, it would appear that I have some bizzare fascination with rush hour trains.&nbsp; I would say that it is an interest in the daily lives of people in other countries.&nbsp; Like in <a href="/dispatch/2006/03/20/the-sport-of-rush-hour-train-boarding-in-mumbai-india">Mumbai, India,</a> I made a special point to got to the Tokyo train station at rush hour.&nbsp; Actually, I got up early to ride a packed train this morning just to see what it was like.</p><p>Once I got on, I was amazed at the absolute silence and how the volume of people meant that no one had to hold on. I was against the door and the girl next to me had her should in my back for the whole ride.&nbsp; I only rode for two stops and felt good that I didn&#39;t have to be in the middle of all the people.&nbsp; Here&#39;s a shot from inside that doesn&#39;t do it justice:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/75-155428771_e83294c4f4.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;These guys man some of the busiest stops on the line and they physically push people into the cars before the doors close. I didn&#39;t get to see it myself, unfortunately.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/62-155434231_4b8e8c681e.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;And so, we&#39;re coming to a close of the Japan-based blogging, which is greatly enhanced by high speed internet connections in Japanese hotel rooms.&nbsp; We&#39;re off to Bangkok in the morning and I imagine we&#39;ll write a little more about Japan before it&#39;s all over. </p><br class="clear" />

    <p class="MsoNormal"><st1:city><st1:place></st1:place></st1:city><br /><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/24-141942168_98e7fb6cf9.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Sumo wrestling is a truly Japanese affair dating back some 1500 years.<span>&nbsp; </span>According to our handy sumo pamphlet that we received at the first day of the <a href="http://www.sumo.or.jp/eng/">Tokyo Grand Sumo Tournament</a>, it started as a religious activity dedicated to the gods with prayers for a bountiful harvest.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Sumo practiced today is heavily influenced by ancient tradition and ceremony.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, it sometimes seems like a ceremony where wrestling suddenly breaks out.</p>      <p class="MsoNormal">Most impressive for me was the sheer size of the wrestlers.<span>&nbsp; </span>I swear one of their legs weighs more than me.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yet, they move surprisingly quickly. There are no weight limits, so wrestlers of very different sizes may face off making for a battle of speed over brawn. Some of the biggest are actually white guys from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Yugoslavia</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Bulgaria</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of them, Kotooshu, is a contender for becoming a yokozuna- the coveted position of highest rank.<br /><img src="/files/includes/images/39-141942071_996b454974.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /><o:p> <br /></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Each match, particularly in the more competitive classes, is a dramatic event with the wrestlers facing off, kicking their feet high in the air, stomping down and then stepping away, as if the moment was just not right (the shikiri).<span>&nbsp; </span>They go to their corners, drink water, wipe sweat and slap themselves before then next face off.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/39-141942112_36e1337acc.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Once both wrestlers are ready, they come together (the tachi-ai) in what sometimes looks like a slapping contest, each defending himself by pushing away the upper body of the other, who is often trying to reach for his mawashi (the only clothing- a silk loincloth).<span>&nbsp; </span>There are 82 winning tricks and most involve gripping and leveraging the mawashi.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contest is decided when a wrestler (rishiki) falls down in the circular ring (dohyo) or is forced outside it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most matches are over in a matter of seconds and ends the day for both wrestlers (one day of 15 in a grand tournament).</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/42-141942271_ad4052ee03.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /><o:p> <br /></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">The tournament is an all day affair, but the action really happens between <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4-6pm</st1:time>.<span>&nbsp; </span>At the Ryogoku Kokugikan Arena, spectators can rent FM radios and hear announcers in English for a deposit of 2000 yen.<span>&nbsp; </span>We liked the insight, but you had to deal with overt cheesiness on the behalf of the American announcer who would say things like &ldquo;Whoa! get out the maple syrup!<span>&nbsp; </span>He made a pancake with that move!&rdquo; &lt;groan&gt;.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">All in all, a great Japanese experience. Anyone visiting <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city> should try to make a day of a tournament. Our mid-range tickets cost about US$75 per person.</p><br class="clear" />

It was like sailing a catamaran into the shipping lanes of a busy port- you clearly have no business there and you must proceed at your own risk. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;These guys will run you over in a second:</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/53-141088812_d0de4a4160.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">I have feeling that tourist access to the market will be limited in the future as it has for the seafood auction.<span> The market is moving locations soon and my bet is that the tourist experience will change with location.</span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/52-141089099_2b35a7dd8f.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /> <o:p> <br /></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/49-141089207_3f3cd7c2d4.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="500" width="375" /></p><p class="MsoNormal">Despite being in the way, we proceeded into the bowels of the market and it was an experience I will never forget.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve never seen so many tuna and in such huge sizes.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/45-141089266_786ecc2641.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /> </p><p class="MsoNormal">As our friend Gen described, the fish make an interesting journey to your plate.

  <p>We have to admit that the movie &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; has left an indelible mark on our expectations of what your supposed to do in Tokyo. There is surely no better place on earth to experience the karaoke phenomenon and last night we repeated the experience of the characters in the movie and rented a karaoke cube for two hours- from about 1:15-3:15AM at a cost of US$58 including a drink and two dishes of gyoza. (Karaoke is singing along to music videos you choose.) </p><p>Of course, you can&#39;t fully experience karoake without a few drinks, so we also went to have dinner and take part the famous Roppongi nightlife.&nbsp; Once again, Sachi&#39;s japanese skills enabled us to find restaurants that do not cater to foreigners and have menus that look like this:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-140675751_1f8355afdc.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>We had sashimi.&nbsp;</p><p>Roppongi is known as a place where foreigners go for nightlife and there are hundreds of bars, taking up the first 5 stories of real estate for many blocks.&nbsp; For some surreal atomsphere- we went to a reggae bar (in Tokyo remember), where I played darts with a guy named &quot;Hide&quot;. Later we went to the Motown Bar, where I couldn&#39;t believe the popularity of the Mexican beer Corona and the number of attentive bartenders.

  <p><a href="http://gen.kanai.net/">Gen Kanai</a> is a Japanese New Yorker who has been living in Tokyo for about 3 years.&nbsp; In fact, he grew up within a couple of blocks from the Murray Hill neighborhood where we stayed in <a href="/47/dispatch/2005/12/13/on-location-new-york">New York in December.</a></p><p>Anyway, Gen and I know some of the same folks and when plans were made to visit Tokyo, we made plans to meet Gen there.&nbsp; Last night we went out to a very nice and tasty tempura restaurant called Ginza Tenkuni, which has been around since 1885. More on the food in a minute.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-140015832_905e34086b.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>What excited me was learning about the Japanese gadgetry.&nbsp; First, we met at the Apple store in the Ginza district and used their computers to find a restaurant.&nbsp; Then, Gen put the restaurant&#39;s phone number into his GPS-enabled phone.&nbsp; From that point, the phone guided us to the restaurant with voice commands as we walked through Ginza.&nbsp; In Japanese, the voice from the phone would say &quot;In 50 meters, turn right&quot;. I was very impressed.&nbsp; Also, did you know that the Japanese don&#39;t use SMS (short message/chat)?&nbsp; They use email for mobile text communications. This is the mobile GPS system...</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/45-140015866_968861c313.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Once we got to the restaurant, it was obvious that we had entered a very fine and traditional tempura house, which is a bit like a high class sushi bar, but only serving seafood and vegetables fried in a light batter. The quality of food was equalled by the japanese service and ambience that could be described as beautiful. The experience was quite a treat.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-140015899_c126c5d6bb.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>One of the dishes I had never had was the fried shrimp legs.&nbsp; They were better than they sound- further proving my point that frying anything makes it better. :)&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/54-140015934_45f83ccf6e.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;We owe a big thanks to Gen for his hospitality.&nbsp;  </p><br class="clear" />

  <p>I was telling Sachi today about my excitement about Tokyo and Japan in general.
