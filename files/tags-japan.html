  <p>I think the locals thought we were weird when taking pictures of signs and menus.&nbsp; We were reminded how sensitive language is - replace a few words with synonyms and the results end up a tad off target and usually hilarious. <br /></p><p>&nbsp;This was just before boarding a cable car in <a href="/47/tags/china">China</a>:</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/81-223673860_17e28f9686.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /></p><p>&nbsp;Also in China, at the <a href="/47/three-gorges-dam">Three Gorges Dam</a>.&nbsp; Billions of dollars on the project and they couldn&#39;t hire a translator for the sign every tourist sees?&nbsp; Welcome to China.

      <h2><a href="/tech_report_japan" title="Tech Report: Japan">Tech Report: Japan</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: <a href="/profile/leelefever" title="View user profile.">leelefever</a> on August 11, 2006 - 11:11pm</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p><i>Part of our trip is focused on experimenting with technology and mobile networks as we travel around the world.&nbsp; A <a href="/47/tags/techreport">tech report</a> is our way of relating the geeky side of what we&#39;re discovering. </i> <br /></p><p><st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> is one of the places in the world that one would expect to encounter the highest technology and in many ways, we were not disappointed.&nbsp; However, in terms of testing and using the Japanese mobile network, we were left in the cold. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>&rsquo;s mobile network evolved without integration with the GSM international standards. So my Treo 650 was worthless in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; GSM &ldquo;worldphones&rdquo; will not integrate with the Japanese network, though the word on the street is that this may change soon. Japan does use CDMA, but it is not as prevalent as their PDC system.&nbsp; </p><p>This quote from an <a href="http://www.japan-zone.com/new/mobile_sim1.shtml">informative Japan Zone article</a> may help:</p><p><span class="blockquote"> 		Very briefly, there are three mobile phone technologies supported by the major networks within Japan - PDC (Personal 		Digital Cellular), CDMA (Code Divisional Multiple Access) and WCDMA.  DoCoMo, Vodafone and TU-KA support the established 		PDC, and DoCoMo and Vodafone have also introduced the newer WCDMA, while AU supports CDMA.  All three of these 		technologies are incompatible with each other.</span></p><p>It is possible to <a href="http://www.rent-mobile-phone.com/japan/">rent phones</a> while in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, but we didn&rsquo;t.  </p><st1:country-region><st1:place></st1:place></st1:country-region>  <p class="MsoNormal">Within <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the mobile network is quite sophisticated.&nbsp; One of the more advanced capabilities I experienced was when we met up with <a href="/dispatch/2006/05/03/geeking-out-with-gen-kanai">Gen Kanai in <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city></a>.&nbsp; He looked up a restaurant&rsquo;s phone number, put the number into the GPS tool on his phone and then had the phone lead us to the restaurant with a dynamic map and car-style voice commands. Mobile GPS- very cool and something I think (hope) we&rsquo;ll all have in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region> soon.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/45-140015866_968861c313.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">I had assumed that the Japanese are big users of SMS (short message system), but this is not the case.&nbsp; They do use their phones for text communication, but it all occurs via email, not SMS.&nbsp; The difference is the same as it is between instant messaging and email on your home computer.&nbsp; </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">More than any other Asian country, in-room Internet access in the norm, and often with blazing fiber-optic connection speeds.&nbsp; I made a habit of bit-torrenting all sorts of things while in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Internet caf&eacute;s are accessible from nearly everywhere, but not nearly as pervasively as in other Asian countries. Like the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>, I imagine that home computers and mobile capabilities limit demand for caf&eacute;s.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Wi-fi is available somewhat ubiquitously, though we did not seek it out often. In most urban settings, I would see networks available, but mostly secured.&nbsp; In the remote Alpine&nbsp; mountain <st1:place><st1:placetype>village</st1:placetype>  of <st1:placename>Kamikochi</st1:placename></st1:place>, where there is not really even a town, we found a strong wi-fi signal, much to our delight.&nbsp; </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">If I could do it over again, I would likely rent a Japanese phone and give it a test run.&nbsp; It is also important to remember that buying electronics abroad can sometimes be hazardous.&nbsp; Products like cameras, computers, etc. are meant for the Japanese public and not visitors so they have instruction manuals, cords and even keyboards/controls built to Japanese specifications.&nbsp; </p>  <br class="clear" />

  <p>Being that we&#39;re leaving from Tokyo, we decided to come back to experience three specific things that we didn&#39;t get to do on our first visit to the city.&nbsp;</p><p>First, is what are called the cos-play-zoku, or costume play gang, that gather in Harajuku&#39;s Jingu-bashi in outlandish costumes.&nbsp; They like having the attention for the most part, but you get the feeling that they aren&#39;t doing it to impress the tourists that photograph them.&nbsp; They stick together and take lots of photos of one another too.&nbsp; A weird and fun experience that we recommend highly.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/52-154654144_212f0b7d3f.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;I didn&#39;t smell anything bad.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/73-154654077_5b411ce819.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;You rarely see any young Japanese person without a mobile phone, even if they are wearing a little bo peep outfit.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/77-154653989_f9eb2740fa.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;This is just plain scary and reminds me of Bangkok.<br /></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/44-154653921_0d2cc9d3bc.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>Next on the list was seeing the Shibuya crosswalk on a busy day. It is the busiest crosswalk in the world.&nbsp; Amazing.</p><p>&nbsp;This is before:<br /></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/64-155424645_9fe7038848.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;and after:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/70-155424719_d996d06f62.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Lastly, it would appear that I have some bizzare fascination with rush hour trains.&nbsp; I would say that it is an interest in the daily lives of people in other countries.&nbsp; Like in <a href="/dispatch/2006/03/20/the-sport-of-rush-hour-train-boarding-in-mumbai-india">Mumbai, India,</a> I made a special point to got to the Tokyo train station at rush hour.&nbsp; Actually, I got up early to ride a packed train this morning just to see what it was like.</p><p>Once I got on, I was amazed at the absolute silence and how the volume of people meant that no one had to hold on. I was against the door and the girl next to me had her should in my back for the whole ride.&nbsp; I only rode for two stops and felt good that I didn&#39;t have to be in the middle of all the people.&nbsp; Here&#39;s a shot from inside that doesn&#39;t do it justice:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/75-155428771_e83294c4f4.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;These guys man some of the busiest stops on the line and they physically push people into the cars before the doors close. I didn&#39;t get to see it myself, unfortunately.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/62-155434231_4b8e8c681e.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;And so, we&#39;re coming to a close of the Japan-based blogging, which is greatly enhanced by high speed internet connections in Japanese hotel rooms.&nbsp; We&#39;re off to Bangkok in the morning and I imagine we&#39;ll write a little more about Japan before it&#39;s all over. </p><br class="clear" />

  <p>TwinF readers know that we&#39;re a bit cynical about the tourist experience and look for the authentic things that make a place unique or different.&nbsp; It only takes a few seconds on the streets of Tokyo, Osaka or Kyoto (or even in small towns) to feel that Japan is a very different place. Here are some of the things we&#39;ve seen (or haven&#39;t seen):</p><p>Something that has bugged me is that there are very few trash cans in public places (compared to home). I sometimes carry trash around for 10 minutes looking for a proper receptical.&nbsp; The Japanese are very particular about their trash and I think it&#39;s a good thing.&nbsp; However, it does mean that some instruction is required.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/49-151189209_e2572cd15b.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;In every city there are buildings filled with tiny bars.&nbsp; There are hundreds of them and one night we decided to check out a few.&nbsp; Walking into one of these tiny bars is like walking into someone&#39;s living room and running one of their friends off the couch.&nbsp; We were not welcome and it was obvious.&nbsp; Signs like this display the bars by name:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-152406072_1d506be677.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;Another ubiquitous part of walking around is the prevalance of platic food.&nbsp; The Japanese have mastered the art of creating plastic versions of the dishes served within a restaurant.&nbsp; I rely on them and remain astonished at how good plastic food can look- and it never spoils! </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/49-151189292_5e02f6cb2b.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;The Japanese have also made life easier for blind folks by providing a raised strip of sidewalk that leads to public transport, toilets, etc.&nbsp; Not really remarkable, but truly ubiquitous.&nbsp; They are everywhere.</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/54-153630909_0eeae86079.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /></p><p>&nbsp;In Japan, you might see gas pumps that hang from the ceiling:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-144325773_cfa1b070be.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Or cantaloupes that cost&nbsp; US$46.00.&nbsp; This is an example of &quot;omiyage&quot;, which is a present that someone brings back to friends after traveling.&nbsp; Thanks to omiyage, the Japanese take gift shops to a whole new level.&nbsp; It is the most perfect cantaloupe I&#39;ve ever seen. </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/50-146114809_38f4438a71.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>Or these contraptions, which must be some sort of bench.&nbsp; I cannot find a comfortable way to sit in one.&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;m too big.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/51-141088399_350882c148.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>In Japan, you might even see hotels (often called Love Hotels) that display their rates as such.&nbsp; Love Hotels are (supposed to be) used for couples who cannot get privacy at home, thanks to granny and the kids. </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/45-153631286_f284c93b5c.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;My brother Randy went to Japan and one of his points was that every square inch of land is utililized for something productive.&nbsp; He was right.&nbsp; Outside of the cities you don&#39;t see yards beside houses.&nbsp; Instead, you see rice paddies, which are much more productive than plain old grass.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/46-149763102_e24bca387d.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>The vending machines in Japan could be a whole other post.&nbsp; Pocari Sweat is a bit like Gatorade and became one of my favorites.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/50-153654519_18e658f849.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;I heard about beer in vending machines so much, but we rarely saw any.&nbsp; We figure a law must have changed.&nbsp; Though, at one hotel we had vending machines for beer, whiskey and sake.&nbsp; I like this quote from punk band The Ramones: &quot;We came across a miracle, there was beer in the soda machine&quot;.&nbsp; Some of the best and cheapest food comes from places where you pay a vending machine outside and take a ticket inside to be served.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-155421258_5cd2c673ac.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" />&nbsp; <br /></p><p>In Japan, a constant source of hilarity is what some call &quot;<a href="http://www.engrish.com/">engrish</a>&quot;, or English translated from Japanese that comes out a bit, um, off.&nbsp; A perfect example.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/48-148641777_1a8db3f726.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;In Japan, you&#39;ll see heaps of young Japanese women struggling to walk with torturous high-heeled footwear.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure if they don&#39;t know how to walk in heels or if their shoes are not meant for walking, but I truly feel sorry for them. Sometimes they fall down.<br /></p><p>We&#39;re just hours from leaving at time of writing and I will miss Japan.&nbsp; Quirky, beautiful, tasty, fun, Japan has it all.&nbsp; I&#39;ll be back.&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />

  Something we would recommend if you want to get outsdide of the cities around Kyoto is the Hozu Gawa River Trip.  You take a train out to the mountains west of Kyoto and take a wodden boat thorugh the mountains for two hours.  For us, the most entertaining part was listening to the reactions of the Japanese girls in front of us.  Good fun and beautiful scenery.  <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/yewNErGGzPI" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="350" width="600"></embed><br />  Of course, this was a bit different than the Shotover Jet River Boats in New Zealand...<br />  <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/g61vQLfLBGc" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="350" width="425"></embed><br class="clear" />

  <p>With Osaka as our base we took a few days and went to two of the major cultural centers of Japan: Kyoto and Nara. </p><p>The first capital of Japan was in Nara and Kyoto was the home of the emperial family for much of its history.

  <p>The area around Osaka, which includes Kobe, Nara and Kyoto, is the cultural center of Japan and where we based ourselves for 5 days.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>We used Osaka as a base and stayed at the <a href="http://www.hotel-riva.com/">Hotel Riva Nankai</a> in the Minami area, which was an excellent location (like Osaka&#39;s Times Square), but priced a bit more than we wanted at about US$120 per night.&nbsp; Luckily, there was a mix-up and we had to change rooms and they gave us a better room for about US$85.&nbsp; Woo-hoo!</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/60-154686847_6ba7a3e9c9.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>So we kicked around Osaka some.&nbsp; The aquarium was pretty amazing as it has the largest single indoor tank in the world which contains a whale shark- the world&#39;s largest species of fish.<br /></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/33-151934772_7d02f2df06.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;I really dug the jellyfish.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/49-151934819_1b482d7242.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Osaka is a bit grungier than the other cities we visited.&nbsp; The fashoin is a little more urban and people are generally more boisterous.&nbsp; This made for the best people watching in Japan.&nbsp; All the rage in Osaka were knee-high black stockings and brightly colored heels:</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-151935826_4c9cea695e.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /> </p><p>All the guys have bleached hair worn a bit like the &quot;hair bands&quot; in the 1980s.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/64-153631347_2fad10ca05.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;We also saw a baseball game: the Osaka Buffaloes against Yokohama.&nbsp; First of all... buffaloes?&nbsp; They couldn&#39;t find anything more Japanese than that?&nbsp; The game on the field was just like any American baseball game, but the crowd was a different story.&nbsp; Each team had live marching bands in the outfield bleachers that made the most noise as their team&#39;s batter was at the plate.&nbsp; Everyone was seated, even during a homerun, when they beat inflatable bat-things together furiously.&nbsp; At one point, everyone blew up balllons and let them go at once.&nbsp; Apparently we didn&#39;t get the memo, but it made for a cool spectacle.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/47-154681506_2109e462fb.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Then of course, the Japanese have invented innovative ways to dispense beer (that is a small keg on her back and a tap&nbsp; in her hand).&nbsp; This photo also provides further proof that it is impossible for Japanese girls to be in front of a camera without a &quot;peace sign&quot;.<img src="/files/includes/images/24-153631109_728bee92f9.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>To cap it all off, we had a roto (conveyer belt) sushi joint behind our hotel, where we went twice to enlarge our stomachs.&nbsp; The sushi just keeps coming.</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/67-154686799_9ad9eac54d.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /></p><br class="clear" />

  <p>&nbsp;<st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> seemed like the perfect place for me to get the most durable souvenir I could imagine- a tattoo.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ll talk about why I choose a Butterfly Koi soon, but for now I want to describe the process.    </p><st1:country-region><st1:place></st1:place></st1:country-region><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p>I had been considering a tattoo for many years and have a few designs stashed away should the inspiration hit.<span>&nbsp; </span>Upon arriving in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, I learned about the history and style of tattoos in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> and thought it would be perfect timing.<span>&nbsp; </span>The inspiration had hit.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">In a modern-history nutshell, the Japanese government used to tattoo prisoners, which led to tattoos being a symbol of criminals (<i>perfect!</i> I know).<span>&nbsp; </span>In the 18<sup>th</sup> century, released prisoners would seek out an Irezumi-shi &ndash;a Japanese tattoo artist who could cover their criminal past with new tattoos.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Japanese Irezumi style evolved from this past and is now considered the most artful in the world.<span>&nbsp; </span>Visiting dignitaries like King George V had a tattoo placed on his forearm in 1881.<span>&nbsp; </span>It helps too that <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> (and her tattoo studios) are very clean and responsible.</p>        <p class="MsoNormal">I cannot claim that my tattoo is in the Irezumi style, as it lacks color and is not elaborate or intricate.<span>&nbsp; </span>After resigning myself to the event, I spent a lot of time on the design, taking inspiration from these two pictures among others.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leelefever/154497458/"><img src="/files/includes/images/54-154497458_f80460f98d_m.jpg" align="left" height="189" width="175" /></a></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leelefever/154497430/"><img src="/files/includes/images/53-154497430_7bb3bad6af_m.jpg" height="240" width="83" /></a> </p><p class="MsoNormal">(The artwork on the right is by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Barbara+Psimas&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Barbara Psimas</a>)&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">My goal was to get a small tattoo placed on the inside of my right arm and high enough that that tattoo would not peek out from under a short shirtsleeve.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here are the drafts, including the final one in the middle.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/63-154468516_7198671836.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">I took these drafts to a <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5pm</st1:time> appointment at <a href="http://www.chopsticktattoo.org/splashy.html">Chopstick Tattoos</a> in <st1:city><st1:place>Osaka</st1:place></st1:city> on May 25th.
