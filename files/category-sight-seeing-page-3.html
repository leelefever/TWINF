  <p>Agree with Jordan's comments on crowds. Shrink your personal space and expect nudges and bumps as a matter of course. </p><p>I had an&nbsp;interesting experience at the Golden Computer Centre, a massive comglomeration of computer vendors piled in together in a 2 story building.&nbsp;I purchased some software for some silly amount like $4 a piece, and was told to come back to the stall in 20 minutes. When I returned, an old man led me through the back hall, we went out a side door,&nbsp;crossed the street, went up half a block, and then he started to go&nbsp;in a tiny hall with stairs leading up.&nbsp;At that point I halted and started to say enough was enough, but then someone else came down with the stairs and handed over a small paper bag with a couple of warm&nbsp;CDs in it. Hmmm. </p><p>Anyway for sights, check out the southern area on South China Sea. Repulse Bay has a nice beach, Stanley Market has brand name&nbsp;soft&nbsp;goods and fine linens&nbsp;for dirt cheap, the waterfront walk at Stanley is very european with cafes and restaurants.&nbsp; There's a water community in Aberdeen. Although much smaller because of&nbsp;government efforts to relocate families to land, when I was there in 2004 there were&nbsp;still six women who had never set foot on land. Ever. Market boats travel within the floating community with produce and goods and sell. You can take a boat&nbsp;tour&nbsp;through the &quot;neighborhood&quot;, on the same boats that take you out to the Jumbo floating restaurant. </p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="info">By: aread on October 7, 2005 - 12:48am</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>If you decide to do the Red-Centre in Australia, I have to suggest that you book a tour. We've done it both with and without, and we had a much better experience with.</p>  <p>Everything is a good 300km apart when you get to the middle of Australia. It's much too hot to do anything durning the afternoon, so the only way to enjoy it is to get up at 5am to get to where you want to be and walking before 7. You then really have to drive for a good part of the afternoon to get to the next site.  It's tough without a bit of help</p>  <p>We went with a small tour of about 16.  The tour guide was experienced and knew how to avoid the worst of the crowds, and could talk about the history and geology and what not of the area.  We also saw some things we missed and never would have seen without a guide.  Sitting in the van and letting someone else do the driving was also a nice change from spending the afternoon trying not to fall asleep behind the wheel. The food was taken care of, we had a place to sleep and a pool at night, and the group was small enough that it was easy to get along with everyone.</p>  <p>The Red Centre itself is beautiful. I've yet to see anything else like it.  If you get to a bit of a high point, it looks like there is nothing between you and the western shore of the continent except for brush and red dirt. It's one of the few places you can still experience something of the Aboriginal People as well.  It's what North Americans generally think of when we hear Australia, and I don't imagine you'll feel like you've seen Australia until you've been there.</p><br class="clear" />

  We went to the Netherlands a while back and by far the best thing was renting a bike (you can do it near the train stations) and just riding around on a bike like every other Dutch person.&nbsp; We rode out into the countryside a bit and it was great.&nbsp; The Indonesian food was delicious.&nbsp; When in Amsterdam, before you smoke pot like every other American who goes there, stop by the The Anne Frank house, touristy thing, but really cool if you like history.&nbsp; I read that story and could never imagine how&nbsp;there could be rooms attached to a house that no one could see or even know was there.&nbsp; When you go to the area,&nbsp;it makes complete sense.&nbsp; Also touristy but great...the Keukenhof (sp could be off) Garden.&nbsp; Quintessential flower Garden.&nbsp; Beautiful, and the drive out there goes past all the tulip fields so go in the spring if you can.&nbsp; And above all, stop by an art museum or two.&nbsp; Many great works and artists are from this area.&nbsp; You have to see art when you are there...Vermeer, Van Gogh, etc.&nbsp; Be sure to visit places like Delft,&nbsp;The Hague,&nbsp;or Skavinagen (spelling way off - but it is a famous beach town)&nbsp;for a day.&nbsp; Don't just go to Amesterdam.&nbsp; It would be like going to New York if you want to see the US.&nbsp; Safe Travels!<br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/blog/dbarefoot/on-safari-in-londolozi" title="On Safari in Londolozi">On Safari in Londolozi</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: dbarefoot on September 27, 2005 - 3:48pm</div>

    <div class="content">

   <p><img width="100" vspace="3" hspace="3" height="75" align="left" title="On safari in South Africa" alt="On safari in South Africa" src="/files/includes/images/1-620692_39415c5e58_t.jpg" />This morning I watched a leopard stalk and attack an impala. The leopard was spotted before she could strike, so there was no kill (fortunate or unfortunate, depending on who you&rsquo;re cheering for). After that we sat in the Land Rover surrounded by a herd of massive cape buffalo, some close enough that you could touch them. Later, we watched an elephant suck nine litres of water into its trunk and dump it into its mouth.</p>    <p>This is the Londolozi private lodge. It&rsquo;s part of the Sabi Sand (those are two rivers), a game reserve home to a group of private camps. The reserve borders Kruger park, and shares a border with its much larger public cousin. </p>  <p>I've never stayed in a more luxurious place--it's like Martha Stewart's Ewok village. There are 160 staff to care for 60 guests, and everyone of them knows your name from the moment you arrive. The setting is extraordinary--the main lodge stretches out from a cliff face, with an exceptional view over the jungle. The lodge itself has 30 exceptionally-appointed rooms, mostly standalone houses above the Sand River.</p>  <p>Each day we go for two three-to-four hour safari drives, one at 5:30 AM and another at 3:30 PM. One day we also did a walk through the bush, an hour-and-a-half back to camp. We saw everything--you name a southern African animal and we watched it. Plus, we saw a vast range of birds and plants. We were assigned a game ranger and a tracker for the entire visit, and they were exceptionally knowledgable. We learned a tremendous amount, not only about flora and fauna, but also about conservation efforts and wildlife management. The tracker--oddly named Exxon--seemed able to pick up tracks out of seemless dirt.</p>  <p>After Kruger, with its massive space and intermittant sitings, I was skeptical about Londolozi. Were we just going to see pop-up animals? Londolozi is still big--we saw new terrain and portions of the reserve each day. But I feared that the private park would feel artifical.</p> <a name="more">  </a> <p>In truth, it seemed pretty natural. Our sitings were vastly improved over the private game park, but I put that down to four factors. One, we rode in Land Rovers, which aren't required to stay on the rode. These amazing vehicles can go pretty much anywhere--they regularly drove over small trees. Two, the skill and experience of the rangers and trackers. Three, the communication between the staff. Though we rarely saw another group, the rangers were in constant contact by radio, discussing the position and behaviour of the animals. This meant that if another group spotted and followed a leopard for a while, we could pick up the pursuit after they left. Lastly, the reserve has been there for at least 60 years, so there are plenty of animals who are natural residents.</p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="info">By: Casey Kaufman on August 26, 2005 - 1:08pm</div>

    <div class="content">

  You guys are gonna be all over SE Asia and skipping Cambodia would be a big mistake. You MUST go to Siem Reap to see the Temples of Angkor. Cambodia is a great country and the people are very friendly. Travel there is definitely rough...the roads are terrible, it is really dusty, and you will sweat a lot. Along with this, it sort of feels dangerous to be there, given the country's history...but that makes it more fun. I didn't go to Myanmar, but it seems like it would be the same way. In order to really appreciate it, you must book a 2 or 3 day tour of the temples. You can hire moto drivers through your hostel, or guesthouse, as they are called, to drive you around and explain the ruins. The complex is huge and it is hard to comprehend it all, muchless take enough pictures. The town of Siem Reap is nice and there are a bars and restaurants to entertain at night. There is even a local pizza restaurant that uses special herbs and spices...I think it is called Happy Pizza. Other musts include the landmine museum and the tribute sites to those who lost their lives under the rule of Pol Pot. You will see a lot of people who have lost limbs due to landmines begging for money, and it is hard to tell them no. I found other places throughout Cambodia to be interesting as well, but you have to see the Temples of Angkor.<br class="clear" />

  <p>Here's some advice for you... Wear a secure pouch for your valuable documents. As you move around, it will be important to have a secure place for things like your passport.  </p>
<p>Remember to get something that is comfortable against the skin and can be washed.  You'll have it with you all the time and it'll get stinky!</p>
