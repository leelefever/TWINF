    <div class="info">By: leelefever on June 11, 2006 - 2:57am</div>

    <div class="content">

  <br /><p class="MsoNormal">Like many travelers, we understood that <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> would be an expensive place in which to travel.<span>&nbsp; </span>After spending a month in the country, we&rsquo;d like to provide our perspectives on how much travel costs for tourists in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp; </span>All prices are in American dollars.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">In visiting any country as a tourist there are 5 costs that must be considered:<span>&nbsp; </span></p>    <ol style="margin-top: 0in" start="1" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal">Arrival      - The cost of getting there (and leaving) </li><li class="MsoNormal">In-Country      Transportation- The cost of moving around within the country</li><li class="MsoNormal">Lodging-      The cost of having a place to sleep each night</li><li class="MsoNormal">Food      and Alcohol- Keeping the belly full</li><li class="MsoNormal">Tourist      Activities- Seeing and Doing</li></ol>    <p class="MsoNormal">Unfortunately, the first 3 of the 5 costs for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> are likely the highest you&rsquo;ll pay in almost any country- but there are some ways around the high expense.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <ol style="margin-top: 0in" start="1" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal"><b>Arrival</b> &ndash; It is generally      expensive to fly into <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>      from anywhere in the world.<span>&nbsp;      </span>However, there are places in the world that serve as major hubs and      you may find that departing from these hubs can reduce the costs. We      bought a round trip ticket from <st1:city><st1:place>Bangkok</st1:place></st1:city>      to <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city> for about $650 per      person, even during <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>&rsquo;s      holiday season (Golden Week- April 25<sup>th</sup>- May 5<sup>th</sup>).<span>&nbsp; </span>We hadn&rsquo;t seen any tickets under $1,000      other than the ones we purchased.<span>&nbsp; </span>The      best advice is to plan ahead, be prepared and jump on any tickets that are      below your expectations.</li></ol>    <ol style="margin-top: 0in" start="2" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal"><b>In-Country Transportation</b> - This      one is an absolute no-brainer.<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>      has an amazingly safe, efficient and comfortable rail system that serves      almost the whole country.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you      plan to travel to more than one or two cities it is essential that you      purchase a &ldquo;<st1:place><st1:placename>Japan</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Rail</st1:placename>       <st1:placetype>Pass</st1:placetype></st1:place>&rdquo; or &ldquo;JR Pass&rdquo;.<span>&nbsp; </span>You must get the JR Pass before you      leave - you CANNOT get one in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.      The JR Pass web site has listings for ticket agents worldwide.<span>&nbsp; </span>We bought a standard 14 day pass for      $391 per person.<span>&nbsp; </span>That seems like a      lot, but once you start seeing how much inter-city train travel costs,      you&rsquo;ll be glad you have the pass.<span>&nbsp;      </span>For instance, a one way trip from <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city>      to <st1:city><st1:place>Kyoto</st1:place></st1:city> on the Shinkansen      bullet train costs about $200 per person.<span>&nbsp;      </span>We figure that our JR Pass paid for itself within the first week of      our trip.<span>&nbsp; </span>Taxis are rather costly      too and we took them very rarely.<span>&nbsp;      </span>In <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city>, the charges      start at about $5 and can quickly rise to over $50 on a late night trip      home (subways stop around <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>).      Further, most major cities have subways (not covered by the JR Pass) that      cost $1-$3 point-to-point</li></ol>    <ol style="margin-top: 0in" start="3" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal"><b>Lodging</b> &ndash; Tourist lodging in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>      can be a complex mix of western rooms vs. Japanese style rooms, regular      hotels vs. business hotels, ryokans vs. hotels and hostels.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hostels offer the lowest rates ($20-50      per person) and the high end reaches to thousands of dollars.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the whole, staying in hotels in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>      is an expensive affair, with 2-3 star western-style rooms costing $70 per      night or more for two people. Often there are different prices for the      number of people, enabling a single traveler to find a cheaper room.<span>&nbsp; </span>For $80-$120 you get the regular hotel      amenities (TV, A/C, bathroom, tea, breakfast, etc.) along with some      Japanese treats like a yukata (robe), slippers, a shoe horn, disposable      toothbrush, etc.&nbsp; Near most train stations are &ldquo;business hotels&rdquo; which lack character, but have convenient locations, basic amenities (plus in-room Internet connection) and a decent price.<span>&nbsp; </span>We found business hotels to be useful and easy for our travels in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> and usually paid between $60-$80 per night.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you want the Japanese experience of staying in a <a href="/47/ryokan">ryokan</a> (traditional Japanese traveller&rsquo;s lodge), we suggest going to a nice one and paying the $200 for the whole experience.   </li></ol>  <ol style="margin-top: 0in" start="4" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal"><b>Food and Alcohol</b> - Aside from the      basics listed above there are other costs that should be considered.<span>&nbsp; </span>Food, of course, tops the list.<span>&nbsp; </span>Food is one thing in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>      that offers a number of choices for different travelers.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is possible to eat street-side      noodles or a rice bowl meal for less than $4 dollars and then walk around      the corner to a tempura restaurant that is $100 per person. Like many      things in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>,      you pay for the experience.<span>&nbsp; </span>Also,      as a <a href="/47/blog/truthchild/eats-under-5-and-with-no-japanese">TwinF member mentioned</a>, there are great choices in the convenience      stores, like 7-11, which have delectable sushi rolls for about $2.<span>&nbsp; </span>We found nearly all food, cheap or      expensiv,e to be delicious, fresh and of high quality.<span>&nbsp; </span>Also, you will surely drink your weight      in Japanese tea, which is generally served free of charge.&nbsp; The Japanese must consume more beer per capita than any other country.<span>&nbsp; </span>Beer is sold everywhere and the prices are quite reasonable, depending on your drinking habits. A can of beer is usually about $2 from a vending machine and a draft beer in a restaurant is about $3-4.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sake is also very popular and the prices vary widely based on reputation and quality, like wine.</li></ol>        <ol style="margin-top: 0in" start="5" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal"><b>Tourist Activities</b> - One of the      wonderful things about <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>      is that by simply being there, your tourist ambitions are fulfilled.<span>&nbsp; </span>Walking the streets, riding the trains      and sitting in parks all offer the tourist a view into the quirky and      entertaining culture &ndash; free of charge.<span>&nbsp;      </span>You will pay for entrance into castles, some temples and shrines,      etc.<span>&nbsp; </span>These are usually between      $5-10 per person. On the whole though, tourist activities in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>      are not prohibitively expensive and the most rewarding things are free.</li></ol>    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in"><b>So, to answer the question: Is </b><st1:country-region><st1:place><b>Japan</b></st1:place></st1:country-region><b> Expensive?</b><span>&nbsp; </span>We would say yes.<span>&nbsp; </span>We spent about $200-250 per day, all inclusive. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Compared to a place like Thailand, Japan is 3-4 times more expensive on a day-to-day basis.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, the expense is the cost of admission to experience a truly unique, sophisticated and beautiful country that is extremely safe, clean and very rich in culture.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was well worth our money.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/monetoriumcairns" title="Standing in Line for the Monetorium, Cairns, Queensland Australia">Standing in Line for the Monetorium, Cairns, Queensland Australia</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: sachilefever on February 24, 2006 - 1:01am</div>

    <div class="content">

    <p class="MsoNormal">The game is on folks! We decided for this very rainy evening on a movie at the big mall in central <st1:city><st1:place>Cairns</st1:place></st1:city>. We haven&rsquo;t seen very many previews or trailers, and we have been noticing that movies and TV series are released later here than in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>, so off we went to check out the selection. We stood in line and asked the clerk about <st1:city><st1:place>Munich</st1:place></st1:city> showings &ndash; it was only showing during the day, not in the evenings. Why?</p><p class="MsoNormal">So we discussed it and stood in line a second time. We went for Derailed with Jenifer Aniston and I&rsquo;m not sure who the main actor was. AUD$29 (US$22). What? A ticket was $14.50. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it, but bought the tickets anyway. Maybe that&rsquo;s <st1:city><st1:place>Cairns</st1:place></st1:city>. We must have lost the Monetorium game tonight.</p><p class="MsoNormal">We then had a few hours before the movie so we walked around the food court of the mall. At the last stall, an Indian place was offering a meal and movie deal. Instead of paying $14.50 for a movie, we could get a meal, drink AND a movie ticket for $16. Don&rsquo;t forget I could have leftovers for breakfast too. We were in. Only&hellip;we already had tickets&hellip;could we get the tickets we purchased earlier refunded? I didn&rsquo;t want to buy the package if we couldn&rsquo;t get a refund!</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The third time standing in line we realized we met up with the same clerk again &ndash; she laughed and with a confused shrug helped us with the refund. Okay, now we can get the meal deal with the movie passes. The curry was good and we ate before we stood in line for the fourth time to use our new passes with full tummies. </p>  <br class="clear" />

After practically being berated by a woman at the A&amp;A hotel down the street, we ended up at the Whitsunday Palms Hotel in Proserpine, Queensland, Australia (it has AC - YAY!).<br /><br /> The older gentleman running the place is skinny and tattooed in the way that reminded me of a WWII vet. He and his little white yippy dog welcomed us with the normal but more charming motel spiel.<br /><br /> Even before we paid, he said &quot;Oh, let me get you some fresh milk&quot; and came back with a metal cream server filled with cold milk, and covered with a rather dainty weighted doiley (pictured above) as if was as normal as the room key which he had yet to provide.<br /><br /> I said nothing, but gathered the key, paperwork and my new cup of milk and walked out to join Sachi, with a silly grin on my face that I'm sure said - well, this is something new.<br /><br /> The best we figure, it's for coffee or tea, even though there are milk packs in the mini-fridge.  All I could think about was how well the new milk will go with my value packs of cereal in the morning. </p><br class="clear" />

    <p class="MsoNormal">People have asked a lot what it feels like a month before this all begins.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been thinking about that too.&nbsp; What does it feel like?</p>     <p class="MsoNormal">There are different ways to look at the situation over the next few weeks.&nbsp; We could begin to wean ourselves from our daily rituals and work to ease the transition through practice.&nbsp; We could minimize and prepare.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Or, we could live life trying to take advantage of every minute of our blissful domestic existence.&nbsp; We could maximize and take it all in.</p>     <p class="MsoNormal">Our dog Amos is one example with an easy answer.&nbsp; If we minimized, we could start to disengage a bit and try to get ourselves prepared for missing him.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not too doable, so we&rsquo;re going for the full-on maximizing- trying to take advantage of every minute.&nbsp; He is more spoiled all the time.</p>     <p class="MsoNormal">Knowing that our food choices will be limited and we will long for the comfort of our home choices of food, we&rsquo;re faced with a similar decision.&nbsp; We could start experimenting with more healthy and practical options, minimizing our normal diet in preparation.
