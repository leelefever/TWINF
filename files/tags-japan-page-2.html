    <div class="content">

    <p class="MsoNormal">Sachi had a very well-traveled instructor in grad school that told her that he feels confident in getting around in any country in the world- except <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp; </span>I agree.<span>&nbsp; </span>If not for Sachi, I would be completely confused for most of our time here.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is simply no English spoken or written in a number of places we go. Looking around, you find nothing but signs written in kanji or kana - the Japanese alphabet of symbols- other than on Starbucks and Mister Donut signs.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I feel so illiterate when looking at a menu.<span>&nbsp; </span>I know nothing- not one word, number or letter.<span>&nbsp; </span>I just have to depend on Sachi to do her best to read and talk to the server about what they have.<span>&nbsp; </span>I just look around at plates, point and make little utterances like &ldquo;hai&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/52-146870125_5d712ce9c4.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Our situation here differs from what we&rsquo;ve experienced so far in the trip.<span>&nbsp; </span>Except for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region>, every country we&rsquo;ve visited is a Commonwealth country- a former English colony.<span>&nbsp; </span>The colonial roots make the passage of English speakers in these countries a smooth one, with decades of practice in communicating in English. And <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region>, though never colonized, has long been a destination of Europeans.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, quite proudly, does not have a colonial past.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, some would say that the history of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> is more marked by isolation than anything else.<span>&nbsp; </span>Though you see Japanese tourists <a href="http://www.tourism.jp/english/statistics/outbound/">all over the world</a>, the vast majority of the population does not travel outside of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, they do travel inside the country in great numbers.<span>&nbsp; </span>My bet is that 95% of the tourists we&rsquo;ve encountered in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> have been Japanese.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s really no wonder that English speakers find <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> to be a hard nut to crack.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">For now, I just smile and say my konnichi wa&rsquo;s and onegaishimasu&rsquo;s and look to Sachi when they come back to me with a litany of words that seem completely incomprehensible.<span>&nbsp; </span>I know that when the sentence ends in &ldquo;desuka&rdquo;, it is a question and I am supposed to answer. Usually though, I have to look back at them and Sachi blankly, sending the not-too-secret message to Sachi that I&rsquo;m helpless.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thankfully, she can usually get us (me) through with flying colors and I can answer with something like &quot;America&quot; or &quot;hai&quot;. Good and gracious translator, that Sachi.</p>  <br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/ryokan" title="Japanese Culture Defined: The Meigetsu Ryokan Inn">Japanese Culture Defined: The Meigetsu Ryokan Inn</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on May 12, 2006 - 9:27pm</div>

    <div class="content">

    <p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryokan_inns">Ryokan Inn</a>, or Japanese style hotel, is really a must-do while visiting <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> as it offers a traditional Japanese traveler experience that, for foreigners like me, is highly unusual and surpisingly luxurious. <o:p></o:p></p>  <p>A few days ago, we visited the small mountain town of <st1:city><st1:place>Tsuwano</st1:place></st1:city>, population 5,500.&nbsp; Having had our eye on staying in a ryokan, we figured this would be the place. Unsurprisingly, a train conductor ended up leading us through the town to two different inns.&nbsp; The last of which we chose to spend the night, as the other was full. It was called the Meigetsu Ryokan- and we recommend it.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/49-145033296_b3c72dafe1.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p>A night at a ryokan usually involves a single room for the night, dinner and breakfast, a private bath, an ofuro or group bath (more on that later) and the love and care of the host. Most ryokans are in scenic locations and are often costly.&nbsp; Ours was about $175 for the night- but well worth it.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/56-145033270_51b3f47723.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p>In no other place have I been immersed in so much traditional Japanese culture - from the environment to the food to the people. Our room had the traditional tatami mat floors- 8 mats on the main room, 6 mats in the entry way (traditional rooms in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> are measured by the number of tatami mats that fit on the floor).&nbsp; The sliding doors, or shoji doors, were made of light weight wood and paper. In the middle of the room was a single table holding on it a tea set.&nbsp; In a closet in the entry way were the mats and comforters used for making a bed on the floor, as is the tradition.&nbsp; Simple and elegant, the room had everything we needed.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p>Before dinner, I went to the bath, for another traditional Japanese experience.&nbsp; In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, people bathe often in onsen or ofuro baths, which are steaming hot group baths with men and women separate. It&rsquo;s like Japanese people soup and is another must-do in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>  <p><span>&nbsp;</span>I had hoped for an empty bath where I could be my foreigner-self.&nbsp; As my luck would have it, I found three aging Japanese men, all naked and in various stages of the bath.&nbsp; And then there was me - six foot three inches of pure self-consciousness, a true bath rookie holding nothing but a small white towel and a nervous smile. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>  <p>According to standard bath behavior, you are supposed to rinse off before entering the actual bath, which amounts to a large wooden bathtub.<span>&nbsp; </span>Two of the men were currently in the rinse cycle and I had no where to go, so I stood there wishing I knew more Japanese or had done this sort of thing before.<span>&nbsp; </span>Luckily one of the men left and I was able to use the handheld shower nozzle for a cursory rinse.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course, I had showered before ever arriving at the bath, but felt the need to send the message that I knew what was going on and respect the tradition of entering the bath clean.<span>&nbsp; </span>So I rinsed and climbed into the bath with one of the men who knew much more English than I did Japanese, thankfully.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was from <st1:city><st1:place>Sapporo</st1:place></st1:city>, in the north of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> and I couldn&rsquo;t help but tell him that I knew about <st1:city><st1:place>Sapporo</st1:place></st1:city> from the beer.<span>&nbsp; </span>He laughed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, as is the case with every male in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> who learns I&rsquo;m from <st1:city><st1:place>Seattle</st1:place></st1:city>, we discuss baseball and mainly Ichiro, <st1:city><st1:place>Seattle</st1:place></st1:city>&rsquo;s star outfielder from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve found that Japanese men know much more than me about American baseball on the whole.<span>&nbsp; </span>He promptly left and I finally found myself alone in the bath, relieved and wondering about my chances of getting out without any more weird, bath-based interactions.<span>&nbsp; </span>I made it out, dried off with what seemed like a large facial tissue, put on my robe and went back to the room to relax before dinner.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sachi met the Ichiro fan&rsquo;s wife in her bath and surely had more productive conversation than me.</p>  <p>Part of the cost of the ryokan is justified by the excellent Japanese food and this ryokan was no exception.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dinner was served in our little room and included about 17 dishes of various sizes per person. The meal was a spectacularly elegant and delicious affair, all laid out before us in a particular and precise manner by our host, a sweet little lady in a kimono.<span>&nbsp; </span>She took a liking to Sachi, who could talk to her in Japanese.<span>&nbsp; </span>At one point, they even had a playful argument about who was going to make the bed.<span>&nbsp; </span>I couldn&rsquo;t understand a word, but knew exactly what was happening.</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/55-145033476_ba33279bac.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p>I&rsquo;m finding that Japanese food is more delicate in flavor than I would have thought.<span>&nbsp; </span>Much of the traditional food- sushi, tempura, noodles, rice, etc. has a light taste, nice texture and a sensual kind of aftertaste that hangs in your mouth, begging for more. This meal was similar. It was not rich and savory.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was delicate, unique, exotic, healthy, impeccably presented and genuinely tasty.<span>&nbsp; </span>As there wasn&rsquo;t a main course, we laughed at our dilemma in choosing what to eat from the many plates of small things that included a soup, sashimi, fruit, various pickled vegetables, sake and soup with egg that we cooked at the table.<span>&nbsp; </span>My favorite was the sashimi. </p>  <p>We both like escargot covered in butter and garlic, but had never eaten a snail right out of the shell like this one.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was good, but had a bitter aftertaste that I do not wish to taste again.</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/48-145033500_84bfca410c.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p>After the meal, we drank a little more sake and moved the table out of the way to make room for the bed, which is made by piling beach towels-sized mats one on top of the other.<span>&nbsp; </span>We used all the mats, maybe 10 of them, to create a soft bed on the floor that was then covered with big comforters; all quite luxurious, even for a bed on the floor.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/46-145033525_7f8b03ae04.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p>The next morning we had a traditional Japanese breakfast, much in the same style as the dinner before, ending our experience at the ryokan.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/54-145033563_afcc8b420e.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>I personally feel somewhat lucky that I made it out without punching a hole in the paper doors while putting a shirt over my head or something- that would totally be my luck. </p>  <br class="clear" />

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on May 10, 2006 - 6:13pm</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>Since we arrived, we&#39;ve been considering adding some time to our stay in Japan.&nbsp; Part of the decision hinged on our ability to change the flights- would their be a fee?&nbsp; Could we do it online? Where is a Thai Airways office?</p><p>Sachi found a partial address for a Thai Airways office in Fukuoka, Japan, on the island of Kyushu.&nbsp; Our journey to the Thai office further convinces us that Japan is worthy of 10 more days.</p><p>We struck out on the subway headed for a station that is supposed to&nbsp; be near a building called &quot;Hinode&quot;.&nbsp; So, as usual, we stepped out of the subway and into an utterly unfamiliar world.&nbsp; After asking 3 different people, we arrived at the Hinode building and found no sign of Thai Airways- then the fun really began.</p><p>We asked a young guy, who proceeded to go out of his way to make sure we found Thai Airways.&nbsp; He went back to his office and returned with his PDA and looked up the address.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/54-144333070_e8c32af957.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>He then went outside twice and returned, only to go back outside another time.&nbsp; After literally running around the lobby of the building, he motioned us to follow him through a back door.&nbsp; The back door went down and alley and around a street corner to the other side of the building, where we found Thai Airways.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/53-144325829_e853c757c9.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>He didn&#39;t only tell us where it was, he looked it up and went outside and checked it himself before coming back to get us.&nbsp; The Japanese are unerringly helpful in this way.&nbsp; We were both so impressed and really wanted to buy the guy a beer or lunch or something, but he just accepted our many arigatos with a smile and went back to work.&nbsp; I wonder if 10 more days will be enough? </p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="content">

    <p class="MsoNormal"><st1:city><st1:place></st1:place></st1:city><br /><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/24-141942168_98e7fb6cf9.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Sumo wrestling is a truly Japanese affair dating back some 1500 years.<span>&nbsp; </span>According to our handy sumo pamphlet that we received at the first day of the <a href="http://www.sumo.or.jp/eng/">Tokyo Grand Sumo Tournament</a>, it started as a religious activity dedicated to the gods with prayers for a bountiful harvest.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Sumo practiced today is heavily influenced by ancient tradition and ceremony.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, it sometimes seems like a ceremony where wrestling suddenly breaks out.</p>      <p class="MsoNormal">Most impressive for me was the sheer size of the wrestlers.<span>&nbsp; </span>I swear one of their legs weighs more than me.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yet, they move surprisingly quickly. There are no weight limits, so wrestlers of very different sizes may face off making for a battle of speed over brawn. Some of the biggest are actually white guys from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Yugoslavia</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Bulgaria</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of them, Kotooshu, is a contender for becoming a yokozuna- the coveted position of highest rank.<br /><img src="/files/includes/images/39-141942071_996b454974.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /><o:p> <br /></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Each match, particularly in the more competitive classes, is a dramatic event with the wrestlers facing off, kicking their feet high in the air, stomping down and then stepping away, as if the moment was just not right (the shikiri).<span>&nbsp; </span>They go to their corners, drink water, wipe sweat and slap themselves before then next face off.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/39-141942112_36e1337acc.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Once both wrestlers are ready, they come together (the tachi-ai) in what sometimes looks like a slapping contest, each defending himself by pushing away the upper body of the other, who is often trying to reach for his mawashi (the only clothing- a silk loincloth).<span>&nbsp; </span>There are 82 winning tricks and most involve gripping and leveraging the mawashi.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contest is decided when a wrestler (rishiki) falls down in the circular ring (dohyo) or is forced outside it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most matches are over in a matter of seconds and ends the day for both wrestlers (one day of 15 in a grand tournament).</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/42-141942271_ad4052ee03.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /><o:p> <br /></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">The tournament is an all day affair, but the action really happens between <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4-6pm</st1:time>.<span>&nbsp; </span>At the Ryogoku Kokugikan Arena, spectators can rent FM radios and hear announcers in English for a deposit of 2000 yen.<span>&nbsp; </span>We liked the insight, but you had to deal with overt cheesiness on the behalf of the American announcer who would say things like &ldquo;Whoa! get out the maple syrup!<span>&nbsp; </span>He made a pancake with that move!&rdquo; &lt;groan&gt;.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">All in all, a great Japanese experience. Anyone visiting <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city> should try to make a day of a tournament. Our mid-range tickets cost about US$75 per person.</p><br class="clear" />
