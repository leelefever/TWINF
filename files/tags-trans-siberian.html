    <div class="content">

    <p class="MsoNormal">It&rsquo;s quite apparent that the Russians have mixed feelings about <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> (depending on where you ask) and after a few days there I think we feel the same. It was at once harsh and smooth, rude and friendly, ugly and beautiful.<span>&nbsp; </span>Overall though, I&rsquo;d say it was better than I expected.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/105-252293946_b2e37f4a21.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Of course we had friends in the city that showed us around their neighborhoods and homes, which was a perfect introduction to the city. The warmth of the personal connection with people in <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> made us feel at home.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, once we ventured out on our own, other sides of the city appeared</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/95-252293749_5a1db75ef7.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Suddenly I found myself in center of the former Communist stronghold, surrounded by reminders of the Bolshevik Revolution, the <st1:country-region><st1:place>USSR</st1:place></st1:country-region> and Communism.<span>&nbsp; </span>I saw the Kremlin-adjacent apartments where Stalin&rsquo;s cronies were arrested and shot.<span>&nbsp; </span>I ate at places where people once stood in line for bread.<span>&nbsp; </span>All the things I learned about the Russians and Communism were right there before me and I could feel the power.<span>&nbsp; </span>In <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> the grandeur of the buildings are awe-inspiring &ndash; monuments to a government that controlled 1/6<sup>th</sup> of the earth&rsquo;s surface and had plans for world domination.<span>&nbsp; </span>This was the place, right under my feet.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/95-252294291_a25f28aa21.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">And it is beautiful.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tiananmen has nothing on <st1:place>Red Square</st1:place>. The parks, rivers and thoroughfares are quite delightful, especially on a nice day. <span>&nbsp;</span>I had no idea that <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> was covered in parks. The legendary Metro subway system is showing its age, but still maintains a world class level of elegance and efficiency.<span>&nbsp; </span>The street food is always-on and yummy. The drab and cold <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> I expected was a distant vision, but some of what I had heard was confirmed.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">It is said that <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> is the &ldquo;dictator&rdquo; and <st1:city><st1:place>St. Petersburg</st1:place></st1:city> is the &ldquo;artist&rdquo; and having visited both, it is obvious why.<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> is not a warm and fuzzy sort of place for the visitor.<span>&nbsp; </span>Customer service is very short and cold, there is no English anywhere and downtown sometimes seems covered in police. The people you encounter appear quite gloomy with very few smiles. Also, there is no affordable lodging in the center of town, forcing travelers 20 minutes outside the city.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/100-252293791_9f5acf5def.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">One of the important things that travelers must remember in <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> is to carry copies of their visa and passport with them at all times.<span>&nbsp; </span>Often police/military will stop foreigners and ask for passports to extort large sums of money.<span>&nbsp; </span>If an actual passport is handed over, it may cost to get it back.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of our friends was caught urinating outdoors by a young military officer in an oversized uniform and threatened with the &ldquo;Gulag&rdquo; if he didn&rsquo;t hand over his actual passport instead of copies. Our friend pretended to call his embassy which caused the officer to reduced the penalty to 500 Rubles (USD$20).<span>&nbsp; </span>They ended up settling at 200 Rubles. To be fair to both sides &ndash; public restrooms are impossible to find in <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city>, and the military boys do not get paid one ruble for their two years of mandated service.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/108-252294153_375d086a33.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">On the other side of the coin, the personal experiences we had with random Muscovites were more positive.<span>&nbsp; </span>While looking at a map on a street corner one night (the &ldquo;tourist distress call&rdquo;) a friendly young woman pointed us in the right direction.<span>&nbsp; </span>It seems that in general, the young people represent a new generation of Muscovites who are more likely to smile, provide great service and welcome foreigners.<span>&nbsp; </span>I would love to come back to <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> in 15 years to see how it has changed.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m quite sure that it will be less of a dictator.</p>  <br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/too_much_vodka" title="Too Much Vodka with the Russian Locals">Too Much Vodka with the Russian Locals</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on September 25, 2006 - 6:04am</div>

    <div class="content">

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Given the opportunity, we will choose to hang out with the locals and in nearly every instance.<span>&nbsp; </span>The vast majority of the time, it has been a rewarding and interesting experience.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, on the Trans-Siberian Railway we&rsquo;ve learned that there are Russian locals that you don&rsquo;t necessarily want to &ldquo;experience&rdquo; for 2 days on a train.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Peer pressure is an issue on the Trans-Siberian train with consistent reminders from other travelers that this is the &ldquo;vodka train&rdquo; and you must drink Russian vodka.<span>&nbsp; </span>This pressure is lost on the Russian locals though as they need no pressure whatsoever to drink on a train.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is a requirement for them and when mixing with foreign travelers the requirement is shared by all.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">So we found ourselves in the dining car on the second night of a 48 hour journey from Irkustk to Ekaterineburg.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Between Slava, the gigantic ex-Russian Army captain with bullet wounds and Victor, the pudgy Belushi-esque ex-Mafia family man, we had our hands full.<span>&nbsp; </span>While our English friend Paul was busy being pressured by Slava into drinking more vodka than he wanted, I got a dose of vodka with Victor and his fellow Russian friends, who seemed to be complete blockheads.<span>&nbsp; </span>We drank more, became friends, toasted to health, arm wrestled and looking back I can say that I have never witnessed so many scars on so many people.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think these guys have had a hard life.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">For some reason I accepted Victor&rsquo;s invitation for me and Sachi to come to his room and drink more vodka. Not only did this end up with me losing a few hours of memory, but it caused Sachi to end up babysitting Victor&rsquo;s Coke-spewing 4 year old child &ldquo;Sergei&rdquo; for over an hour.<span>&nbsp; </span>She was not happy and I had no idea why.<span>&nbsp; </span>What I did remember was Victor telling me at some point in the night that the wolf tattoo on his arm was from his 3 year prison term.<span>&nbsp; </span>Apparently had &ldquo;only killed one person&rdquo; while in the Russian mafia.<span>&nbsp; </span>Had I had my wits about me, I may have escaped at that point, but I didn&rsquo;t.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The next day I awoke to a hangover, an upset wife and a half-drunk Russian ex-con banging on the door at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9AM</st1:time> with a 2 liter beer in his hand.<span>&nbsp; </span>We were still friends and he was clearly doing me a favor by bring over the beer. <span>&nbsp;</span>He started with the old Russian saying &ldquo;A good friend drinks vodka with you yesterday, a great friend drinks vodka with you today!&rdquo; as if I might appreciate the classical nature of the moment.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>I would have none of it, despite him barging in, pouring a glass, spilling it on the floor and insisting I drink no less than 15 times. Of course Sachi was now noticing that she would now clean up after both father and son in our compartment. I was at a loss for more ways to say &ldquo;nyet&rdquo; &ndash; nothing seemed to work. Sachi would later say that when he came in she wanted to kick him in the face.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course, I was implicit in this frustration. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Later Victor hooked back up with the Blockheads and they formed a roaming band of drunk-in-the-morning Russian annoyances.<span>&nbsp; </span>They went from one end of the train to the other, peer-pressuring everyone from the night before to drink with them.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of them even forced his way into the compartment of understandably shaken American and Canadian girls.<span>&nbsp; </span>He would later be quite accurately called a stalker.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">This band of drunks eventually caused the revelers from the night before to close their doors and hide out for the majority of the morning.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many, including Sachi and I ignored knocks at our doors.<span>&nbsp; </span>The foreigners on the train tried to memorize compartment numbers so we could visit one another without keeping a door open.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was talk of passwords being used.<span>&nbsp; </span>We were held hostage by the locals.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">By about <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1pm</st1:time> the drunk Russians had passed out &ndash; we could hear Victor snoring through the compartment walls and from that point the foreigners on the train began to appear like refugees after a bombing campaign.<span>&nbsp; </span>Shaken, annoyed and hungover, we stuck together and decided that drinking with the locals is fun, but sharing 2 days on a train with the same people is another story all together.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Watch the <a href="/47/vodka_train">Video Here</a>. <br /></p>  <br class="clear" />

  <p>The train trip has exceeded our expectations in a big way.  The train itself is OK, but Mongolia and Siberia have been highlights of the whole trip, except for my saddle sores.  Unfortunately though, it's a bit harder to upload all the pictures, videos, etc. Once we get into the big cities like Moscow we'll be sharing a lot more. Here is quick video to get started...</p>

  <p>We are&nbsp; about to begin the first legs of the Trans-Siberian Railway, first stop: Ulan Baatarr, Mongolia, where we will spend two nights at a Ger Camp (I&#39;m not really sure either).&nbsp; We are both so very excited - this trip marks the end of Asia and the beginning of perhaps the most anticipated journey of the year. Woo hoo!&nbsp; Here&#39;s the plan:</p><ul><li>September 9<sup>th</sup>: Depart <st1:place><st1:city>Beijing</st1:city>,  <st1:country-region>China</st1:country-region></st1:place> </li><li>September 10<sup>th</sup>:<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:city>Ulanbaatar</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Mongolia</st1:country-region></st1:place> (2 nights plus travel)</li><li>September 14<sup>th</sup>: <span>&nbsp;</span><st1:place><st1:city>Irkutsk</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Russia</st1:country-region></st1:place> (Lake Baikal-Siberia) (2 nights plus travel)</li><li>September 18<sup>th</sup>: <st1:place><st1:city>Ekaterinburg</st1:city>,  <st1:country-region>Russia</st1:country-region></st1:place> (Urals) (2 nights plus travel)</li><li>September 21st:<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:city>Moscow</st1:city>,  <st1:country-region>Russia</st1:country-region></st1:place> (2 nights plus travel)</li><li>September 24th:<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>St.   Petersburg</st1:place></st1:city> (3 nights)</li><li>September 27th:<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:city>Helsinki</st1:city>,  <st1:country-region>Finland</st1:country-region></st1:place></li></ul><p>Of course, this also marks the end of China, which has been amazing in so many ways - mostly unexpected. There is something I&#39;d like to share about China before I go (with more coming later).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Tomorrow (September 9th) is the 30th anniversary of Chairman Mao&#39;s death and today on CNN International (one of two English stations) there was a segment on Mao.&nbsp; Two different sections of the segment were blacked out and we can only guess that the government was involved.&nbsp; There was a specific woman that spoke in the segment and whenever she came on the screen, it went black.&nbsp; This appeared to be blatant media censorship right before our very eyes.</p><p>I doubt I will ever be able to reconcile the contrasts that appear in China.&nbsp; It seems to be going at light speed into the future and stumbling backward at the same time. Amazing. </p><br class="clear" />
