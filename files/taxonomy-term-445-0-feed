 <title>Help with the NEXT 6 Months? (Please)</title>
 <link>http://theworldisnotflat.com/dispatch/2006/05/22/help-with-the-next-6-months-please</link>
 <description>  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re quickly approaching the halfway mark of our trip, which also means that we&amp;rsquo;ve written about 6 months of information and posted 6 months of pictures onto this web site. &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;On our minds recently is what we will post in the next 6 months.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;We want your help with making the next six months more compelling than the past.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;First, we should let you know our goals for the site because there are a few.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Luckily two of the major goals are accomplished with the same stroke- documenting our trip and sharing it with you, dear reader.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Selfishly, we want this site to be our virtual memoir and photo gallery &amp;ndash; something we can refer to in years to come. &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Of course, writing wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be nearly as fun or exciting without knowing that there are people who are interested in reading. &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Your involvement in the form of comments, emails and travel experiences is the secret sauce that motivates us to post as much as we do. &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;That is the beauty of blogging- it&amp;rsquo;s a two way street and when we write, we think about what would be interesting and compelling for you to read.&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;As such, we&amp;rsquo;re curious about your thoughts, ideas and/or feedback.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;What would you like to see more or less of? &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;What you expect to see that we haven&amp;rsquo;t posted?&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Can you think of specific posts (or types of posts) that are your favorites?&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Many thanks and arigatos!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;br class=&quot;clear&quot; /&gt;</description>
