(he split the atom). I also like the Huge oak tree, grown from aa <font size="-1">Acorn</font> sent back by a soldier during WW I, he died, but his tree still grows on the banks of Avon river, ChCh, NZ. <br />  Takes a couple of hours + stops along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>Pity CHCH&nbsp; police station is so ulgy!!&nbsp;<br /></p><br class="clear" />

  Danny and Lizzie Carsons VKNOW RESTAURANT was good when in Queenstown last year. It was the farewell dinner of a cycle trip.  Cnr Richards Park Lane & Fernhill Road, (head towards Glenorchy and Fernhill rd goes up the hill about about 1.8km from Queenstown). A bit out of the main tourist trap town center but worth the effort.

  <p>When you're in Singapore, I hope you find time to visit the Jurong Bird Park or go the the Night Safari. I've been to both and both are well worth the trip. As the name implies, you'll see lots of birds at Jurong (hahahaha). But what I liked about the park is that you get to really interact with the birds too. They hold several programs at their amphitheaters and they usually ask the audience to participate. Going around the park, you may chance upon areas where birds are fed. For S$5.00 (or was it S$2.00?) they will give you a small cup of worms. You hold out your hand and the birds will just come swooping down on the cup. (That's my hand in the photo!)</p><p><img title="feeding the birds" style="width: 180px; height: 240px" height="240" alt="feeding the birds" src="/files/includes/images/25-41999989_932fa238c8_m.jpg" width="180" /></p><p>Afterwards you can go on the night safari. They have&nbsp;several animals in captivity and they've divided them according to location (those found in africa, in the rain forests, etc). The tour is only held at night, and to illuminate the area, they've placed lights with wattage so low (and so cool) the whole place looks like it's bathed in moonlight. Unfortunately, I can't add photos cuz flash photography is not allowed. </p><p>ALSO, if you will go to Sentosa (go up the Merlion), drop by Siloso beach. It's singapore's man-made beach (if i'm not mistaken) and have your photo taken at the Siloso beach sculpture.</p><p><img title="The Siloso Sculpture" style="width: 240px; height: 180px" height="180" alt="The Siloso Sculpture" src="/files/includes/images/30-41998463_17bb92cf20_m.jpg" width="240" /></p><p>(incidentally, free shuttle service to specific drop off points along orchard, and back to the hotel are avaiilable. just ask the concierge for the pick up schedule). ENJOY!! :)</p><br class="clear" />

  <div class="picture"><img src="/files/includes/images/system-files-pictures-picture-230.jpg" alt="Charme&#039;s picture" title="Charme&#039;s picture"  /></div>  <div class="content">

  <p>...than Orchard Road.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you've travelled for thousands or hundreds of miles, the last thing you want to see for your efforts is 'Borders'. Yes, shopping in Singapore is brilliant, and it is good value for money...you can get practically anything under the (rather hot) sun there (have I mentioned that local attempts at fashion are simply gorgeous?!), but for the full cultural experience, might I suggest doing away with the whole 'package tour' deal. Since most Singaporeans speak English (charmingly referred to as 'Singlish') anyway, finding your way around will be no problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do a little research before you go...If possible, get to know a few locals who might be able to take you off-the-beaten-track. Otherwise, a few simple questions at your hotel or any MRT station would usually get you facing in the right direction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To start off, you can visit a wet market (the ground might be slippery, so wear an old pair of trainers with lots of grip), and the temples and shops in Chinatown&nbsp;or Little India. <a title="Sentosa" href="http://www.sentosa.com.sg/" target="_blank">Sentosa</a> is also a nice family resort if you have the time, and Haw Par Villa a themepark with a macabre difference. Singapore is&nbsp;not known as a food paradise for nothing...Authentic cuisines from all over the world&nbsp;are offered there, and at a very cheap price too!!! To cut costs, instead of room service at your hotel, sample the local fare at the outdoor Hawker Centres (email me if you want to know the best places to go, or the best foods to try). Most&nbsp;of them&nbsp;are open from early morning till late at night, some even 24/7. There are also Pasar Malams (night markets/bazaars) where you can haggle to your heart's content.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To learn the local history, take yourself down to the museums (or the waxworks at Sentosa if it's still there) or the <a title="Esplanade" href="http://www.esplanade.com/" target="_blank">Esplanade</a> near Marina Bay, where you can enjoy the artistic endeavours of Southeast Asia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As for the local transport, get yourself an <a title="EZLink Card" href="http://www.ezlink.com.sg/" target="_blank">EZLink Card</a>, which works almost the same way as the Oyster card in London (you can even donate it to a good cause when you leave). Last time I was there, they did a very good deal for tourists, which would also earn you discounts at a few shops and restaurants. The&nbsp;EZLink Card&nbsp;can be used on the MRT and buses...But of course, you could always hire a trishaw!!! <img alt="Tongue out" src="/files/includes/images/47-hm-profiles-standard-modules-tinymce-tinymce-jscripts-tiny_mce-plugins-emotions-images-smiley-tongue-out.gif" border="0" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If it is at all possible, arrange to go during the festive period (such as Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, Chingay, Deepavali or Thaipusam etc...even Christmas is an eye-opener there). Singapore might be tiny, but because of its mixed ethnic cultures, there is a lot to see. The nightlife is also particularly interesting. Boat Quay and Clarke Quay are a stretch of lively bars, restaurants, shops and clubs along the Singapore River. You can get a boat ride from one end to the other, and possibly view the Merlion statue whilst you're at it. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Other&nbsp;venues&nbsp;where you can mingle with the natives and&nbsp;overdose on Singapore sights and sounds are <a title="Fort Canning Park" href="http://www.nparks.gov.sg/nparks_cms/display_park.asp?parkid=7" target="_blank">Fort Canning Park</a> (where you can have a BBQ after a ramble), <a title="Mount Faber" href="http://www.mountfaber.com.sg/" target="_blank">Mount Faber</a> (there's an alfresco bar - Altivo - at the top of the hill), <a title="Chijmes" href="http://www.chijmes.com.sg/" target="_blank">Chijmes</a> (which was a convent school dating back to the old colonial days, now converted to something a little more&nbsp;trendy, and quite possibly sinful), Bugis Street (used to be a the unofficial 'gay district' where some of the old shophouses may still stand in their newly 'preserved' state, although Katong or Geylang&nbsp;might be better places for&nbsp;historical architecture&nbsp;if you don't mind the 'girly bars')&nbsp;etc etc...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are loads more places which I have probably forgot to mention, but it's nothing a little 'Googling' around won't remedy...Here are a few sites to get you going:</p><ul><li><a title="Visit Singapore" href="http://www.visitsingapore.com/" target="_blank">Uniquely&nbsp;Singapore</a>&nbsp;(Official Guidebook)</li><li><a title="CIA World Factbook on Singapore" href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/sn.html" target="_blank">CIA World Factbook on Singapore</a></li><li><a title="BBC Country Profile on Singapore" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/country_profiles/1143240.stm" target="_blank">BBC Country Profile on Singapore</a></li><li><a title="Singapore in Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore" target="_blank">Singapore in Wikipedia</a></li><li><a title="Lonely Planet Guide to Singapore" href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/destinations/asia/singapore/" target="_blank">Lonely Planet Guide to Singapore</a></li><li><a title="Move and Stay Guide" href="http://www.moveandstay.com/singapore" target="_blank">Move and Stay Guide</a></li><li><a title="Transitlink" href="http://www.transitlink.com.sg/" target="_blank">Transitlink</a></li><li><a title="Singapore eCitizen" href="http://tt.ecitizen.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Singapore eCitizen</a></li><li><a title="Street Directory" href="http://www.streetdirectory.com/" target="_blank">Singapore Street Directory &amp; Transport Guide</a></li></ul><p><img title="River Hong Bao" style="width: 230px; height: 160px" height="160" alt="River Hong Bao" src="/files/includes/images/24-88550397_c893c3d946_o.jpg" width="230" border="1" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>PS - The law doesn't actually ban the chewing of gum, but importing or&nbsp;selling it&nbsp;has been prohibited...No, I don't get it either.

    <div class="info">By: bunnygirl on January 19, 2006 - 3:04am</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>When you get the opportunity to visit New Zealand, try to visit the town of Matamata, it's about 45 minutes from Hamilton (almost 2 hrs from Aukland). For only NZ$50.00 you will be able to visit the property that was chosen to be the home of the Hobbits. From matamata itself, it's a 10 - 15 minute drive to the perimeter of the property, and from the gate, it's another 10 minutes. When you get to the site itself, you'll really understand why this place was chosen to be the Shire (or Hobbiton). It's just acres and acres of fields and grass and trees ... and hobbit holes. Of the 37 original hobbit holes, only 17 remain. Tour guides will share anecdotes on how the place was selected, how life was during filming, and what transpired after the shoot.</p><p>here's what you can see there:&nbsp;<img title="hobbit homes" style="width: 500px; height: 375px" height="375" alt="hobbit homes" src="/files/includes/images/36-76530743_3cd8219d6a.jpg" width="500" /></p><br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/blog/darcy/charming-innsbruck" title="Charming Innsbruck">Charming Innsbruck</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: Darcy on January 14, 2006 - 9:41am</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>Innsruck, Austria&nbsp;is charming.&nbsp; The facades of the town's center are colorful and the mountains loom in the backdrop.&nbsp; Here you can visit a former Winter Olympic site, castles and the Golden Roof.&nbsp; This would be a great stopover for when you're looking for a something more laidback and subdued.&nbsp; The architecture and mountains will make for some stunning photos.</p><p>It's a convenient train stop between Vienna and Bologna, IT, if traveling that way.&nbsp; It is often overlooked by travelers, who instead choose nearby Vienna.&nbsp; Vienna is lovely, but missing Innsruck would be a shame.&nbsp; Furthermore, you only need to devote a day or two to cover its grounds whereas some cities you feel like a weekend is never enough time.</p><p>It's much busier in winter (skiing!) and calmer in the summer.</p><p><a href="http://www.innsbruck-tourismus.com/">http://www.innsbruck-tourismus.com</a></p><br class="clear" />
