    <div class="content">

  <p>&nbsp;It took us 4 busses and 3 trains to do it, but we have finally arrived in Narvik, Norway, from Helsinki, Finland - the starting point for exploring the Lofoten Islands and fjords via rental car over the next few days. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A533125">Narvik</a> is a cool little town that has the northernmost train station (and supposedly disco) in the world. It is a few hours north of the Arctic Circle by train.</p><p>This completes our overland trek from Beijing - from the Pacific to the Atlantic across Eurasia. Going from Asia to Norway seems like traversing planets instead of the same land mass. What a contrast.</p><p>On the&nbsp; way through we stopped at Rovaniemi, which is known for being so close to the Arctic Circle and having Santa&#39;s &quot;official&quot; residence.&nbsp; Surprise, surprise - it was a giant gift shop!</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/107-258315479_5f9f63349e.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>I wasn&#39;t really upset - i just love making stupid faces in these contraptions. </p><p>&nbsp;We did cross the Arctic Circle for the first time there though...</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/118-258315316_6d85eb69c8.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /></p><p>...so we can check that one off the list.&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />

  <p>The train trip has exceeded our expectations in a big way.  The train itself is OK, but Mongolia and Siberia have been highlights of the whole trip, except for my saddle sores.  Unfortunately though, it's a bit harder to upload all the pictures, videos, etc. Once we get into the big cities like Moscow we'll be sharing a lot more. Here is quick video to get started...</p>

  <p>  There may be fewer places in the world that are sparking more environmental controversy that the Three Gorges section of China's Yangtze River, where the world's largest dam project is almost complete. More on that soon.  Despite the dam, the gorges before the dam remain a beautiful place and this video (hopefully) captures some of the beauty that, as of October of this year, will be further underwater.</p>

  <p>As a child, I remember seeing pictures of a magical place where the earth seemed to have burst right out of it&#39;s shell and created giant rounded stone mounds, set amongst rice paddies, rivers and farms. I said then that I was going to see that place one day. Much to my enjoyment, we found this place in <a href="http://www.chinahighlights.com/guilin/index.htm">Guilin, China</a>.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/89-216459984_45ad0437a6.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;The mounds are actually called karsts and are made of limstone.&nbsp; 200 million years ago this part of China was under the sea and limestone was thrust upward from the earth&#39;s crust and then eroded into the shapes we see today.&nbsp;</p><p>The karsts are best viewed from a boat on the Li River and as most things in China, it is done as part of a package tour, complete with flag waving guide.&nbsp; Our guide was the delightfully geeky &quot;Jack&quot;. The tour included lunch and costs about US$58 per person. </p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/64-216459168_cd88269423_m.jpg" /></p><p>&nbsp;We learned today that English teachers in China often suggest western names for their students.&nbsp; The person who told us was given the name &quot;Norman&quot; but didn&#39;t like it - so he chose &quot;Steven&quot; instead.</p><p>Jack led us on a 4 hour trip down the Li River, accompanied by a very long line of similar boats, each holding about 100 sweating people.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/72-216460686_b48aba3da7.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;The whole trip was narrated by a women with English skills far inferior to Jack&#39;s.&nbsp; She told us how the Li River &quot;winds through the grotesque peaks exactly like a blue silk ribbon&quot; and how we should watch out for the peaks that &quot;look exactly like 9 oxen&quot;.&nbsp; Most aboard looked around in a confused state, amazed at the scenery nonetheless.&nbsp; And the scenery was amazing.&nbsp; There is surely no other place in the world like the karsts near Guilin - it&#39;s the stuff of poetry and paintings.&nbsp; In fact, the area appears on the back of the 20 RMB (chinese currency) note.<br /></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/84-216460082_8b701f1216.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/97-216460264_50088b5f88.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/62-216460816_3104e3c1ee.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/87-216460465_4a3f50dc5d.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><br class="clear" />

  <p>Typhoon Prapiroon is coming through these parts this afternoon which means ferries to Hong Kong have denied us passage. All boats were tied up to dock this morning after the typhoon signal was hoisted to &quot;8&quot;.

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on July 27, 2006 - 8:22am</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>It&rsquo;s been said many times- be clear with a Vietnamese cab driver about your hotel, or they will take you to their friend&rsquo;s hotel, where they will earn a commission.  We&rsquo;ve seen many attempts at such diversions, but none so blatant as we experienced today, just after arriving in Hanoi.  </p><p>We took a cab from the airport into town (37km for US$10). On the way, we told the driver to go to the &ldquo;Camellia 3&rdquo; Hotel and showed him where it was on the map.  He agreed and the agreement was settled.  Along the way he had a number of phone calls, which rang in a ring tone with the volume on 11. We understood nothing he said.  </p><p>Upon arriving in the Old City of Hanoi, a young Vietnamese guy walked over to the car, opened my door, stuck his head into the car about 3 inches from my face and said &ldquo;<i>Welcome to the Camellia 3 Hotel!</i>&rdquo;  I struggled to look around him at the building and the awning and did not see anything about the Camellia, or any hotel for that matter. No matter what we asked, he continued to insist, quite rudely &ldquo;<i>Yes, this is the place, the Camellia 3 Hotel, let me get your bags.</i>&rdquo; All I could say was, &ldquo;<i>First, please back up and let me get out of the car.</i>&rdquo;  I left Sachi in the car and stepped into what was supposed to be the Camellia 3 Hotel.  I walked to the reception desk and said &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;d like a business card please, where is your business card?</i>&rdquo;  Their answer:  &ldquo;<i>We ran out</i>&rdquo;.  This, of course was a lie and there was no longer any doubt what was happening. This was not the Camellia 3 Hotel.  </p><p>The cab driver must have thought we were complete idiots.  He actually thought that he could drop us off at some random hotel and we would believe, thanks to the not-so-skillful scamming of his not-so-sly cronies, that we had arrived at our requested destination and would blindly get a room, earning him a commission.  </p><p>We&rsquo;ve met a lot of nice people in Vietnam, but it is the prevalence of this kind of bullshit that will forever leave a bad taste in my mouth.  We said to him what we say to all people who try to pull such stunts.  &ldquo;<i>You are bad for tourists &ndash; you keep doing this, tourists will stop coming</i>.&rdquo;  He only smiled with a &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t win&rsquo;em all&rdquo; attitude and went off to give another tourist a good reason not to come back to Vietnam. </p><br class="clear" />
