 <title>Ha Ha, Very Funny</title>
 <link>http://theworldisnotflat.com/journal/2005/08/03/ha-ha-very-funny</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So when we were on a family beach trip last weekend, we heard a
funny joke that was told as it was heard from a stand-up comedian...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So,
I think it&#039;s great, you know, people taking these extended &#039;round the
world trips- but my question for them is- What are you gonna do next
year?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;I&#039;m not even trying to think about 2007 right now.
