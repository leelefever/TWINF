      <h2><a href="/blog/dbarefoot/on-safari-in-londolozi" title="On Safari in Londolozi">On Safari in Londolozi</a></h2>
    <div class="info">By: <a href="/profile/dbarefoot" title="View user profile.">dbarefoot</a> on September 27, 2005 - 3:48pm</div>
    <div class="content">
   <p><img width="100" vspace="3" hspace="3" height="75" align="left" title="On safari in South Africa" alt="On safari in South Africa" src="/files/includes/images/1-620692_39415c5e58_t.jpg" />This morning I watched a leopard stalk and attack an impala. The leopard was spotted before she could strike, so there was no kill (fortunate or unfortunate, depending on who you&rsquo;re cheering for). After that we sat in the Land Rover surrounded by a herd of massive cape buffalo, some close enough that you could touch them. Later, we watched an elephant suck nine litres of water into its trunk and dump it into its mouth.</p>    <p>This is the Londolozi private lodge. It&rsquo;s part of the Sabi Sand (those are two rivers), a game reserve home to a group of private camps. The reserve borders Kruger park, and shares a border with its much larger public cousin. </p>  <p>I've never stayed in a more luxurious place--it's like Martha Stewart's Ewok village. There are 160 staff to care for 60 guests, and everyone of them knows your name from the moment you arrive. The setting is extraordinary--the main lodge stretches out from a cliff face, with an exceptional view over the jungle. The lodge itself has 30 exceptionally-appointed rooms, mostly standalone houses above the Sand River.</p>  <p>Each day we go for two three-to-four hour safari drives, one at 5:30 AM and another at 3:30 PM. One day we also did a walk through the bush, an hour-and-a-half back to camp. We saw everything--you name a southern African animal and we watched it. Plus, we saw a vast range of birds and plants. We were assigned a game ranger and a tracker for the entire visit, and they were exceptionally knowledgable. We learned a tremendous amount, not only about flora and fauna, but also about conservation efforts and wildlife management. The tracker--oddly named Exxon--seemed able to pick up tracks out of seemless dirt.</p>  <p>After Kruger, with its massive space and intermittant sitings, I was skeptical about Londolozi. Were we just going to see pop-up animals? Londolozi is still big--we saw new terrain and portions of the reserve each day. But I feared that the private park would feel artifical.</p> <a name="more">  </a> <p>In truth, it seemed pretty natural. Our sitings were vastly improved over the private game park, but I put that down to four factors. One, we rode in Land Rovers, which aren't required to stay on the rode. These amazing vehicles can go pretty much anywhere--they regularly drove over small trees. Two, the skill and experience of the rangers and trackers. Three, the communication between the staff. Though we rarely saw another group, the rangers were in constant contact by radio, discussing the position and behaviour of the animals. This meant that if another group spotted and followed a leopard for a while, we could pick up the pursuit after they left. Lastly, the reserve has been there for at least 60 years, so there are plenty of animals who are natural residents.</p><br class="clear" />

  <p>Head for Singapore when you need a good dose of English, Western food, and shopping. Orchard Road has all your high-end fashion stores, from Ferragamo to Nine West, and there is a Borders, too. </p><p>The small city can be done comfortably in two or three days, especially if you're seeing other parts of Asia. </p><p>We particularly enjoyed the Night Safari at the zoo, which has lots of animals not found in North American zoos.

  <p>I was in Cape Town in December 1999, and I loved it and recommend it as a place to visit. I have cousins who live in Cape Town, and one who lives in Jo-burg, so I can get good info from them or get you in touch with them, if you like/need.</p><p>South Africa has several distinct wine growing regions, and I visited one near Cape Town, which has the amazing <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=stellenbosch+wine+south+africa" target="_self">Stellenbosch wineries</a> (link goes to Google search with lots of sites that may provide interesting info).</p><p>Also, there is the amazing <a href="http://www.nbi.ac.za/frames/kirstfram.htm" target="_self">Kirstenbosch National Botancial Garden</a> in Cape Town, and lots of interesting wildlife nearby.</p><p>&nbsp;Many of the people whom I met in Cape Town recommended that I travel to Durban and the part of South Africa on the coast of the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean side of the cape is warmer than the Atlantic side, and the area near Durban is supposed to be lush.</p><p>Also, my cousin took me to one of the shanty towns near Cape Town, and I'd recommend you try to do some things like this too (have someone take you--probably don't want to go yourself), and see the whole of the place. The Apartheid regime separated lots of people based on their differences, and it's hard to describe, but something that I think it's important to look for and try to learn from.<br /> </p><br class="clear" />

  <p>Any trip through SE Asia would not be complete without venturing into Laos.  Personally, I chose to enter from the north and take a speed boat to <span class="SpellE">Luang</span> <span class="SpellE">Prabang</span>.  Although the boat trip lasted only half a day, I learned a great deal about Laos and her people.  I recommend the speed boat trip, I spoke with other <span class="SpellE">travellers</span> and heard horror stories about the two day &quot;slow&quot; boat trip...I guess it depends on how much time you have.  On that note, time is not important when <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> in Laos.  Be prepared to wait....and wait for what you are trying to do.  I spent a day and a half waiting for a boat to take me down river.  Understanding this is imperative when <span class="SpellE">travelling</span>.  Along the Mekong, you will stop at various villages for gas, supplies, more passengers, etc.  Don't be <span class="SpellE">suprised</span> if you are asked if you want to buy marijuana.  There is an abundance of the stuff in Laos, but be wary on the river...I heard of police patrols roaming around.  But <span class="SpellE">heh</span>, that's what God made a rectum for, right?  </p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">I'll be back for more tales about </span></font>Laos shortly...</p><br class="clear" />

  You guys are gonna be all over SE Asia and skipping Cambodia would be a big mistake. You MUST go to Siem Reap to see the Temples of Angkor. Cambodia is a great country and the people are very friendly. Travel there is definitely rough...the roads are terrible, it is really dusty, and you will sweat a lot. Along with this, it sort of feels dangerous to be there, given the country's history...but that makes it more fun. I didn't go to Myanmar, but it seems like itÂ would beÂ the same way. In order to really appreciate it, you must book a 2 orÂ 3 day tour of the temples. You can hire moto drivers through your hostel, or guesthouse, as they are called, to drive you around and explain the ruins. The complex is huge and it is hard to comprehend it all, muchless take enough pictures. The town of Siem Reap is nice and there are aÂ bars and restaurantsÂ to entertain at night. There is even a local pizza restaurant that uses special herbs and spices...I think it is called Happy Pizza.Â Other musts include the landmine museum and the tributeÂ sites to those who lost their lives under the rule of Pol Pot. You will see a lot of people who have lost limbs due to landmines begging for money, and it is hard to tell them no. I found other places throughout Cambodia to be interesting as well, but you have to see the Temples of Angkor.<br class="clear" />

<p>I am greatly looking forward to white water rafting while in NZ, and I found this website for access to class 5 rapids. It's located on the northwest coast of the South Island near Hokitika.</p><p>Does anyone know when might be the best time to go? Would there be decent rapids in late January / early February?</p><p><a href="http://www.riverplay.co.nz/AdventureRaftingItinerary.htm">http://www.riverplay.co.nz/AdventureRaftingItinerary.htm</a></p><p /><p /><br class="clear" />

  <p>So, I made it to Luang Prabang in one piece.Â  I did see a few dead animals swirling in the Yoohoo colored Mekong River eddies, but one mammal in particular took the cake.Â  As we swirved down the river, I saw an odd shape in the distance.Â  As we approached to within 50 yards or so, I saw the legs of a man, ass-up swirling counter clockwise in one of the forementioned eddies.Â  He was not diving, or swimming for that matter.Â  In fact, he wasn't moving at all...his legs bent as if sitting in some invisible upside down chair, taught with rigor mortis.Â  A man in a small boat was slowly drifting towards the body.Â  I looked in disbelief, seeing if my fellow passengers, most of whom were w/in a arms distance of me had seen the swirling corpse.Â  Everyone was looking straight ahead, possibly fearing they would end up like the unfortunate man we had just passed.Â  I looked over my shoulder to the pilot of our long, narrow vessel, and he simply smiled at me and gave me a look that I can only assume meant, &quot;Hey, shit happens....&quot;</p><p>After a few days in LP, I took a bus south to Vang Vieng.Â  Definitely worth a stop over.Â  The town is right on the river, I stayed at a place on the far edge of town(the town is only about 5 blocks long) right on the river, very cool.Â  You can rent big inner tubes and float the river next to town...you will pass by enormous limestone mountains that rise vertically from the river banks.Â  A guy from the inn will pick you up down river.Â  Most of the boat guys will offer you some herb, I &quot;saw&quot; people puffing during their inner tube ride and they looked like they were having a great time....highly recommended.</p><p>Unfortunately, the tube ride is probably the only serene way to travel in Laos.Â  The bus rides are absolutely terrifying.Â  I have been to many places where the driving has been sketchy, but Laos is truly scary.Â  The roads are usually gravel and not maintained, mix that with large buses moving at high speeds along single laneÂ  mountain &quot;roads&quot; and you will realize why there are little plastic grocery bags tied on theÂ  ceiling grab rails.Â  You know its bad when it becomes a puke fest on the bus and you realize you are the only non-local there.Â  Just be prepared and try to sit between two Buddhist monks like I did...God loves Buddhism.</p><p /><p>gotta go.</p><br class="clear" />

  <p>If you get a chance, a great town to visit in Ecuador is Salinas de Guaranda. (There is more than one Salinas in Ecuador--this is the one in the Andes, near the city of Guaranda.)</p><p>Salinas is one of the few towns in the Andes where the land is owned by the people who live there. It's an amazing community that has developed a series of small industries, a system of financing, and a community development strategy that has given people living there a much higher standard of living than most people in the Andes.<br /><br />If you go, talk to the people about their community and how it runs. You'll see a pretty remarkable example of how strong leadership can mobilize poor people in the third world and help them improve their lives.</p><p></p><br class="clear" />

  <p>I've traveled my fair share in Southeast Asia -- Thailand three times, Laos, Cambodia, Hong Kong -- but my favorite destination is definitely Vietnam, particularly the northern part of the country, up near Hanoi. The scenery is amazing, the food is good, and the whole country is really just waking up to tourism. (You'll see plenty of travlers in Hanoi and Saigon -- er, Ho Chi Minh City -- but out in the country it's a different story.) Hanoi's French influences and tree-lined boulevards (especially around the Old Quarter) make it a nice place to hang out for a few days. If you're feeling adventurous, rent a motorcycle (or hire a guide), grab a map, and set sail for the countryside. You won't regret it!</p><br class="clear" />

  Laos is a cool and cheap country to travel. Going from northern Thailand to northern Laos (Luang Prabang), one must travel by boat down the Mekong. It is a 2 day trip downriver on a slow boat with hard wooden benches. You can opt to take the fast boat but it looks really dangerous.Â The scenery along the way is mountainous, tropical, and desolate.Â Luang Prabang is a cool city with a lot of French influence. They still sell baguettes on the streets, which is odd, since bread is not common in Asian countries. The local beer is Beer Lao and it is decent. Accomodation is about $2 and up per night, depending on how nice you want it to be.<br class="clear" />
