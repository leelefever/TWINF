    <div class="content">

  <p>When you're in Singapore, I hope you find time to visit the Jurong Bird Park or go the the Night Safari. I've been to both and both are well worth the trip. As the name implies, you'll see lots of birds at Jurong (hahahaha). But what I liked about the park is that you get to really interact with the birds too. They hold several programs at their amphitheaters and they usually ask the audience to participate. Going around the park, you may chance upon areas where birds are fed. For S$5.00 (or was it S$2.00?) they will give you a small cup of worms. You hold out your hand and the birds will just come swooping down on the cup. (That's my hand in the photo!)</p><p><img title="feeding the birds" style="width: 180px; height: 240px" height="240" alt="feeding the birds" src="http://static.flickr.com/25/41999989_932fa238c8_m.jpg" width="180" /></p><p>Afterwards you can go on the night safari. They have&nbsp;several animals in captivity and they've divided them according to location (those found in africa, in the rain forests, etc). The tour is only held at night, and to illuminate the area, they've placed lights with wattage so low (and so cool) the whole place looks like it's bathed in moonlight. Unfortunately, I can't add photos cuz flash photography is not allowed. </p><p>ALSO, if you will go to Sentosa (go up the Merlion), drop by Siloso beach. It's singapore's man-made beach (if i'm not mistaken) and have your photo taken at the Siloso beach sculpture.</p><p><img title="The Siloso Sculpture" style="width: 240px; height: 180px" height="180" alt="The Siloso Sculpture" src="/files/includes/images/30-41998463_17bb92cf20_m.jpg" width="240" /></p><p>(incidentally, free shuttle service to specific drop off points along orchard, and back to the hotel are avaiilable. just ask the concierge for the pick up schedule). ENJOY!! :)</p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="content">

  <p>When you get the opportunity to visit New Zealand, try to visit the town of Matamata, it's about 45 minutes from Hamilton (almost 2 hrs from Aukland). For only NZ$50.00 you will be able to visit the property that was chosen to be the home of the Hobbits. From matamata itself, it's a 10 - 15 minute drive to the perimeter of the property, and from the gate, it's another 10 minutes. When you get to the site itself, you'll really understand why this place was chosen to be the Shire (or Hobbiton). It's just acres and acres of fields and grass and trees ... and hobbit holes. Of the 37 original hobbit holes, only 17 remain. Tour guides will share anecdotes on how the place was selected, how life was during filming, and what transpired after the shoot.</p><p>here's what you can see there:&nbsp;<img title="hobbit homes" style="width: 500px; height: 375px" height="375" alt="hobbit homes" src="/files/includes/images/36-76530743_3cd8219d6a.jpg" width="500" /></p><br class="clear" />

  <p>Innsruck, Austria&nbsp;is charming.&nbsp; The facades of the town's center are colorful and the mountains loom in the backdrop.&nbsp; Here you can visit a former Winter Olympic site, castles and the Golden Roof.&nbsp; This would be a great stopover for when you're looking for a something more laidback and subdued.&nbsp; The architecture and mountains will make for some stunning photos.</p><p>It's a convenient train stop between Vienna and Bologna, IT, if traveling that way.&nbsp; It is often overlooked by travelers, who instead choose nearby Vienna.&nbsp; Vienna is lovely, but missing Innsruck would be a shame.&nbsp; Furthermore, you only need to devote a day or two to cover its grounds whereas some cities you feel like a weekend is never enough time.</p><p>It's much busier in winter (skiing!) and calmer in the summer.</p><p><a href="http://www.innsbruck-tourismus.com/">http://www.innsbruck-tourismus.com</a></p><br class="clear" />

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To get a feel for the size and lay of the land in Bangkok, get on the elevated train and ride from one end to the other and back.&nbsp; It's a cheap, clean and safe way to get around, and the elevated view gives you a nice perspective.</p><p><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hire a long-tail boat for a few hours to take you along the busy river and off into the <i>klongs</i> of the Thomburi side of the city.&nbsp; Don't go with a group - just hire the boat and boatman for the two of you so you can call the shots.&nbsp; It's a great way to see non-urban Thai life without leaving Bangkok.&nbsp; The boatmen have spots where they stop and where they can get a commission if you buy something, but they aren't insistent - if you tell him no, he'll keep going.&nbsp; The less time you waste at tourist stops or temples, the more time you'll have for getting way, way back in the narrow <i>klongs</i>.&nbsp; Keep an eye out for a Washington license plate adorning the exterior of one rickety little wood-frame house on a backwater kong. <br />  </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try to get out at dawn to see the sunrise reflecting off the mosaic-like exterior of temples - very cool as they glitter and glimmer.&nbsp; The Thai temples are really nice - ornate - but for me, see a couple of them and you've seen enough.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, if you're in Bangkok on Saturday, go on up to the Chatuchak Saturday market - it's a zoo, literally and figuratively.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />

  <p>Cairns has the most dive boat options; here are 3 I've liked. All have resort-dive options, for first-timers</p><p>1) Reef Magic - typical medium-size boat, amenities, friendly crew, can get in two dives if not too crowded. Can get a video of yourself diving, photos&nbsp;boarding,&nbsp;but like most everything in Australia it's low-key.</p><p><a href="http://www.reefmagic.com.au/">http://www.reefmagic.com.au/</a>&nbsp;(hmm, seems more commercial now)</p><p>2) I took a small sailboat with 6 pax, 3 crew, and stayed overnight on the reef. Unique experience. Can't remember the name, but you should be able to find it or something similar&nbsp;by asking some knowledgeable booker (booking places all over Cairns). Book this early if you can, as soon as you know your dates, it can fill up. I got a spot a few days ahead of time but it was the low season.</p><p>3) Big boat, day trip to Fitzroy Island (I'll try to stay overnight there next time). You can make a quick stop there and then go on to a dive spot, but I spent several hours, took a snorkle trip near Little Fitzroy Island. Islands might not be novel to Seattlites, but to me it was very cool.</p><p><span dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" size="2"><a href="http://www.fitzroyisland.com.au/">www.<b>fitzroy</b><b>island</b>.com.au/</a></font></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In general, you can find great diving/boating experiences if you look a little deeper than the very common short little trips.</p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="info">By: dbarefoot on December 7, 2005 - 11:26am</div>

    <div class="content">

   <p>I&rsquo;ve discovered that there&rsquo;s perhaps more joy in returning to a place than in visiting it for the first time. At least that&rsquo;s the case if you&rsquo;ve lived in a place, left it and come back. Our mind favours good memories over bad, so we rediscover former homes through rose-coloured lenses. </p>  <p>With that in mind, let me tell you about some of my favourite spots in Dublin:</p> <a name="more"></a> <p><a href="http://www.tcd.ie/">Trinity College</a> - I had the good fortune to walk through this gorgeous, 500-year-old campus every day for most of the time I spent in Dublin. Today I walked through it at dusk, and the light hitting the <a href="http://www.worldisround.com/articles/32266/photo8.html">campanile</a> that stands near the entrance was beautiful. I have fond memories of pausing on my walks home to watch rugby practices and sometimes cricket on the rugby ground and College Park.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.dublintourist.com/Info.cgi/merri002.shtml">Merrion Square</a> - Is there a finer block-long park in the western world? Walk through it during a rainstorm, and its smells like a jungle. It's a tremendously charming place, with its well-tended flora and peculiar <a href="/files/includes/images/fstop-pix-oscarwilde4.jpg">statuary</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.museum.ie/naturalhistory/findus.asp">Natural History Museum</a> - I've <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/2003/03/18.html">written about this place</a> before, so I'll just quote myself:</p><blockquote><i>It is a macabre paean to the Victorian era in all its splendour. Nearly hidden behind the Dail (the Irish Parliament), it's a fantastic Victorian building. The stuffed bestiary that resides inside is beyond compare. Most of the animals are inside glass cases, and each is fastidiously labelled with the name and date of death and purchase by museum. They go on and on and on. There is every animal under the sun in here. And it's not just mammals either--there are four floors, and two of them just have birds and fish and insects aplenty.</i></blockquote>The second floor window of <a href="/files/includes/images/windingstair4.jpg">the Winding Stair Bookstore</a> - It's as bohemian as a cafe gets in Dublin, and despite the uncomfortable benches is an oasis of casual calm in the centre of the city. I wonder, is it named after Yeat's <a href="http://www.bibliomania.com/0/2/332/2432/frameset.html">poem</a>, or did Yeats name his poem after the cafe? Probably, but not definitely, the former. Sadly, it recently closed.<br /> <p>&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />
