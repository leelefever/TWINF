    <div class="content">

  <p>The river boarding was a great experience, but one that I have more memories of pain than pleasure.&nbsp; The basic idea is that you go down the 6kms (3.7 miles) of the Might Meg section of the Kawarau River with a wetsuit, lifejacket, helmet, fins and a boogie board all with class 2-4 rapids. It cost $129 NZ ($91US) per person through <a href="http://www.riverboarding.co.nz/riverboarding/index.html">Mad Dog River Boarding</a>.</p><p><img height="375" src="/files/includes/images/14-94287762_6b4b8c1427.jpg-v-0.jpg" width="500" onload="show_notes_initially()" /></p><p>I thought it might be lame, but I was wrong, very wrong.&nbsp; It was not lame, but somewhat harrowing and scary experience in an adventurous way.&nbsp; My problem was not the water or the equipment, but my body.&nbsp; From the first few hundred feet, my legs began to cramp and for a majority of the 3.7 miles, I was in excruciating pain as both feet and calf muscles cramped &ndash; even as the guides yelled to move across the river to avoid dangerous rapids.&nbsp; Had my legs not cramped, it would have been a different experience overall.</p><p>At the end, there were a few things you could do to finish off the adventure.&nbsp; One of which was jumping into the river from a 30 foot rock ledge. I love jumping off of things and knew this would be fun.&nbsp; The jump was great, but soon after I entered the water, my left arm exited the shoulder socket, dislocating my shoulder for a couple of seconds, sending unbelievable pain through me as I floated to the surface. Then, trying to fight the rapids to the shore, it happened again. I just wanted to sit on the shore and cry, from pain, exhaustion and from discouragement. Looking back, it&rsquo;s an activity I would recommend for those that are prepared for a physical, strenuous and a bit of a scary adventure.&nbsp; Some people cried while doing it, which is a sure sign it&rsquo;s not for everyone.</p><p>Sachi <a href="/queenstownriverboarding">has a different story</a>.</p><br class="clear" />

  <p>I have a bit of a mental issue with Queenstown.&nbsp; I want to call it Queensland, which is in Australia.&nbsp; My brain will not allow me to call it anything but Queensland, leading Sachi to say things like &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s like that there too, in Australia&rdquo;.</p><p>QueensTOWN is known as one of the adventure capitals of the world.&nbsp; It was where bungy jumping was invented and has since spawned all sorts of adventure activities, some borrowed, some invented. </p><p>Among all the choices, we narrowed it down to two- things we&rsquo;d never done and might not be able to do in other places around the world. They were jet-boating and river boarding. </p><p><img height="375" src="/files/includes/images/21-94287759_708efb958d.jpg-v-0.jpg" width="500" onload="show_notes_initially()" /></p><p>The jet boating is one of the &ldquo;big four&rdquo; activities that people do in Queenstown, which also includes Bungy Jumping, River Rafting and Sky Diving. It cost $99NZ ($70 US) per person and included about 25 minutes on the water, run by <a href="http://www.shotoverjet.com/">Shotover River Jet</a>, which is the best, from what we heard.</p><p><img height="375" src="/files/includes/images/35-94287761_1d189f8da9.jpg-v-0.jpg" width="500" onload="show_notes_initially()" /></p><p>The boats are an amazing piece of machinery.&nbsp; They are like jet skis that hold 14 people have twin v-6 engines and can go in 6 inches of water.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never seen anything handle like that, as they cruise through a gorge only inches from rocks. The combination of incredible speed, impressive scenery, precision driving made for a great overall experience.</p><br class="clear" />

James Cook was not bashful about naming all the geographic features of New Zealand and Doubtful Bay is no exception. When he came upon it, he figured that if he went in, he might not make it out because of the prevailing westerly wind.&nbsp; He was &ldquo;doubtful&rdquo; he should do it and the name stuck.</p><p>Thankfully, we have motorized boats that enable us to explore what he missed, and did he miss a lot.&nbsp; Doubtful Bay is part of the Fiordland Region of New Zealand and is stunningly beautiful in a way that cameras can&rsquo;t really capture, with 1000s of feet of sheer cliffs plunging into dark, deep, cold waters.</p><p><img height="375" src="/files/includes/images/30-92987399_a7881bf77a.jpg-v-0.jpg" width="500" onload="show_notes_initially()" /></p><p>It&rsquo;s no small feat to get there too. You have to take a boat across a lake for 45 minutes, then a van over Wilmot Pass on a dirt road for another 45 mins just to get started.&nbsp; We felt alone for a majority of the time with a couple of boats in the distance that represented a bit of &ldquo;congestion&rdquo;.</p><p>We hooked up with an independent overnight tour operator called Deep Cove Charters, LTD.&nbsp; The boat was called &ldquo;Flyer&rdquo;.&nbsp; The skipper, Chris, was great and has to be the hardest working man in the Fiordlands.&nbsp; He does these tours every day (and every night), sometimes up to 20 in a row, dropping a group off as he picks up another. We were all very impressed with Chris and the trip.&nbsp; It was about $300pp NZ ($212 US) per person, but it included a freshly caught crayfish (think lobster) lunch and venison and blue cod dinner and breakfast. </p><p>Flyer holds 6 people and we figured we&rsquo;d end up with 4 non-english speaking folks, which might have been fun too.&nbsp; As it turned out, we spent 24 hours with 2 couples from Minnesota who are traveling together.&nbsp; It was surely the most time we&rsquo;ve spent with Americans on the whole trip and they were great folks.</p><p><img height="375" src="/files/includes/images/25-92987403_75b3eecfe6.jpg-v-0.jpg" width="500" onload="show_notes_initially()" /></p><p>Other than the scenery, the highlight was surely fishing.&nbsp; Sachi caught a bunch of Perch that were used for bait and finally a giant Blue Cod, which we ate that night.&nbsp; I caught a nice sized grouper.</p><p><strong>Look at the size of that thing!</strong></p><p><img height="500" src="/files/includes/images/32-92987402_3592f51973.jpg-v-0.jpg" width="375" onload="show_notes_initially()" /></p><p>OK, it wasn't that big...</p><p><img height="500" src="/files/includes/images/42-92987401_82d1143977.jpg-v-0.jpg" width="375" onload="show_notes_initially()" /></p><p>&nbsp;Here's my Grouper</p><p><img height="375" src="/files/includes/images/14-92987400_1996d66a3a.jpg-v-0.jpg" width="500" onload="show_notes_initially()" /></p><p><strong>A note about &ldquo;Fiordlands&rdquo;&hellip;</strong></p><p>It is supposed to be spelled the Norwegian way &ldquo;fjords&rdquo;, but the current spelling stuck since the 1800&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We learned that a fjord is a body of water that was carved by glaciers and links to the sea as opposed to a &ldquo;sound&rdquo; which is formed by a river. Many of the sounds in New Zealand are actually supposed to be fiords, or better yet, fjords.&nbsp; In fact, we think Seattle is actually on Puget Fjord instead of Puget Sound. </p><br class="clear" />

Ice stairs have been carved for your crampon wrapped boots. Climbing ropes act as make-shift and loose railings. You are part of a line of 7 folks venturing up these stairs together, some right behind the other, others leaving a few steps leeway. Four ladder bridges cross crevasses that seem too far down to look. <o:p /></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><o:p /></span><img width="500" height="375" onload="show_notes_initially()" src="/files/includes/images/31-91523792_c8769fd1ec.jpg-v-0.jpg" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The sun is warm, so no one wears their jackets, but there is a light wind coming across the glacier that is ice cool and refreshing just enough that you forget the sunburn developing on your face.<o:p /></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><o:p /></span><img width="500" height="375" onload="show_notes_initially()" src="/files/includes/images/16-91524472_de5a55cbac.jpg-v-0.jpg" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Apparently, the glacier is advancing, unlike most in the world. We heard 2.5 months ago it was 30 meters shorter than it is now. The guides are constantly maintaining, with a large ice axe, the stairs and walkways and ropes. One guide mentioned that each stairway up the face lasts between 3 and 30 days, and then they carve out a new one. We could see the remnants of melting staircases across a crevasse on the left and then another on the right &ndash; a little spooky.

The park has an other-worldly quality due to the plant species we&rsquo;re not used to seeing. I wish I knew the names other than the national emblem- the Silver Fern.</font></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/12-90766116_91a83fb653.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="3">We had read that the park had become too popular and the &ldquo;crowds&rdquo; had taken away from the serene appeal of the park.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re finding that the Kiwi view of crowded and that of the rest of the world can be vastly different.&nbsp; We did not find an overrun park, but one with desolate accessible beaches and the occasional passer-by.</font></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/33-90766117_7b2b17fb78.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially()" height="375" width="500" /></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="3">In all, we were impressed, but it wasn&rsquo;t amazing.&nbsp; In a lot of ways, it was just a nice hike along a coastline. Would we do it again in hindsight? Likely.&nbsp; Would we recommend it?&nbsp; Yes, but not with great enthusiasm.</font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;</font></p> <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="3"><b>Who is Abel Tasman?</b></font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="3">He has a park (and town)&nbsp;in New Zealand named after him and a sea in between NZ and Australia.&nbsp; He named the country of New Zealand. He has a big Australian Island (Tasmania) named for him.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t we see a lot of references to him in New Zealand history (we wondered)?</font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="3">While he was the first European (Dutch) to discover New Zealand and did map a lot of it&rsquo;s coast in 1642, his encounter was brief and violent. Unlike Capt. Cook who befriended and traded with the Maori, Tasman fought with them and only visited the mainland once.&nbsp; So, his place in New Zealand history is about initial discovery and little else (from what we understand).&nbsp; Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_Tasman">has more</a>.</font></p><br class="clear" />

    <p class="MsoNormal">We have mentioned Squeak a few times, and Mark reminded me that we haven&rsquo;t included any interior pictures for those who have not chosen to live in a van down by the river.&nbsp; So here goes...</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p><br /></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Squeak is an Apollo brand campervan 2-berth (sleeps 2 adults) that is about 3 meters (9 ft) high and 5.5 meters (17ft) long. No Mickey D&rsquo;s drive through&rsquo;s! It fits almost exactly end to end in a normal parking space.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img width="500" height="375" onload="show_notes_initially()" src="/files/includes/images/19-89043452_491e0d2554.jpg-v-0.jpg" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">This is the back of the van with a bench-like set up including a swivel table. The tabletop is placed between the benches and with two other similar boards, a solid platform is created for a bed. It&rsquo;s pretty wide and Lee &ndash; at 6&rsquo;3&rdquo; &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t hang off the end&hellip;Though he is too tall for the ceiling, unless he stands under the top vent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<img width="500" height="375" onload="show_notes_initially()" src="/files/includes/images/27-89043605_28505a9cdd.jpg-v-0.jpg" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><img width="500" height="375" onload="show_notes_initially()" src="/files/includes/images/17-89043987_9da616f508.jpg-v-0.jpg" /><o:p> <br /></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p><img width="500" height="375" onload="show_notes_initially()" src="/files/includes/images/43-89043743_bfdc41b553.jpg-v-0.jpg" /></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Further up is a gas stove, sink, mini fridge, and mini oven on the left and a closet and toilet/shower on the right. The microwave and air conditioner are also tucked high in the corners.

Think squeaking plastic rubbing together. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The other noise is an inevitable closet door spilling open or bananas falling on the floor at the first turn of every drive. We try to remember to close all the knobs to lock the drawers in place and be sure to close the windows and the overhead vent, and then be sure everything on the sink or table has been put away&hellip;but we have almost always forgotten something. Then we start the engine and boom &ndash; this morning it was Lee&rsquo;s clothes cabinet door that spilled the stack. Two days ago the entire utensil drawer littered the floor (Lee opened that one).&nbsp; Is there a trend here?</p>    <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial">The cabinet doors squeak even louder when they are flying open.

This place ranks highly among the places we've seen so far for just kicking back and enjoying the scenery and sun.  Of course it helps that we have the company of <a href="http://mofo-records.com/">Maitland Waters</a>, whose family has an awesome beach house here where we're staying tonight.&nbsp; I met Maitland through <a href="http://www.benjaminbloom.net/feed/weblog.php">Adam Bloom</a>, who I know through <a href="http://www.sirkin.com/nonprofit_emarketing/">Marc Sirkin</a>. Small world indeed.<br /> </p><p>Maitland lives in Wellington and has a radio show tomorrow (Friday) from 12-2 NZ time (3-5 Thursday in Seattle).&nbsp; If you want to hear the live stream, go <a href="/47/http;/www.flatlinefm.co.nz">here</a>. Otherwise, you can always find the podcast <a href="http://mofo-records.com/synchronicity">here</a>.&nbsp; He's gonna plug our trip and we'll put up a picture from the show tomorrow. You might even hear us talk a bit, I dunno. <br /></p><br class="clear" />

  <p>I first met Hal at the <a href="http://blogsndogs.com/">Blogs n Dogs</a> conference in Banff, where he  told me that he spends a lot of time in NZ and would be there when we come  through.&nbsp; Sure enough, we met Hal today with his lovely partner Trish.&nbsp; They  live in the town of North Havelock, just south of Napier, in the heart of North  Island wine country.</p><p>&nbsp;<img width="500" height="375" onload="show_notes_initially()" src="/files/includes/images/12-88148799_381f897ac9.jpg-v-0.jpg" /></p> <p>The theme for today was wine tasting.&nbsp; We went to about 5 different places  including:</p> <p><a href="http://www.matariki.co.nz/">Matariki</a>, <a href="http://www.unisonvineyard.co.nz/">Unison</a> and <a href="http://www.trinityhill.co.nz/flash.htm">Trinity Hill</a> were wines  that were a part of the region called <a href="http://www.gimblettgravels.com/">Gimblett Gravel</a>. In visiting the  wineries, it's easy to see why.&nbsp; The vineyards are planted in soil high in  gravel content.&nbsp; A river used to flow through the region, which imparted the soil with  the gravel.&nbsp; About 120 years ago, the river changed course, leaving the land for  great grape growing.&nbsp; The gravel allows water to flow through the soil more  quickly, intesifying the taste of the grapes (so they told us). At Unison, a tiny winery, the  vinter himself poured our tastings.&nbsp; This is, obviously, Trinity Hill below.</p><p>&nbsp;<img width="500" height="375" onload="show_notes_initially()" src="/files/includes/images/31-88148481_36f98c1d56.jpg-v-0.jpg" /></p> <p><a href="http://www.clearviewestate.co.nz/wine/">Clearview</a> and <a href="http://www.kimcrawfordwines.co.nz/">Kim Crawford</a> were two others  on the Hawkes Bay Coastal village of Te Awanga.&nbsp;</p><p>After the wine tasting, Hal and Trish treated us to an awesome dinner and real bed for the night, which is very welcome after sleeping in Squeak, our campervan.&nbsp; We have had an awesome time and, once again, had a&nbsp; great experience with locals.&nbsp; Trish is a lifelong Kiwi and taught us about the educational system, regional reputations and the Hawkes Bay area.&nbsp; Hal, an American who has done business all over the world, told us great stories about the issues with doing business in China and secrets of the Olympics.&nbsp; Hal and Trish completely rock and we owe them a huge thanks.</p><p>Tomorrow, we're off to Peka Peka Beach and meeting a guy named Maitland who we'll hang with for a couple of days.</p><p>By the way, Sachi was originally going to write this but the wine and dinner got the best of her and she had to retire for the evening.
