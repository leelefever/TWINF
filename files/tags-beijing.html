The scrubby steppe is surely home to bite sized rodents that teased the eagles from their perches.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was not at all odd to see an eagle swoop down and attack just outside the window.

  <p>We are&nbsp; about to begin the first legs of the Trans-Siberian Railway, first stop: Ulan Baatarr, Mongolia, where we will spend two nights at a Ger Camp (I&#39;m not really sure either).&nbsp; We are both so very excited - this trip marks the end of Asia and the beginning of perhaps the most anticipated journey of the year. Woo hoo!&nbsp; Here&#39;s the plan:</p><ul><li>September 9<sup>th</sup>: Depart <st1:place><st1:city>Beijing</st1:city>,  <st1:country-region>China</st1:country-region></st1:place> </li><li>September 10<sup>th</sup>:<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:city>Ulanbaatar</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Mongolia</st1:country-region></st1:place> (2 nights plus travel)</li><li>September 14<sup>th</sup>: <span>&nbsp;</span><st1:place><st1:city>Irkutsk</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Russia</st1:country-region></st1:place> (Lake Baikal-Siberia) (2 nights plus travel)</li><li>September 18<sup>th</sup>: <st1:place><st1:city>Ekaterinburg</st1:city>,  <st1:country-region>Russia</st1:country-region></st1:place> (Urals) (2 nights plus travel)</li><li>September 21st:<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:city>Moscow</st1:city>,  <st1:country-region>Russia</st1:country-region></st1:place> (2 nights plus travel)</li><li>September 24th:<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>St.   Petersburg</st1:place></st1:city> (3 nights)</li><li>September 27th:<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:city>Helsinki</st1:city>,  <st1:country-region>Finland</st1:country-region></st1:place></li></ul><p>Of course, this also marks the end of China, which has been amazing in so many ways - mostly unexpected. There is something I&#39;d like to share about China before I go (with more coming later).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Tomorrow (September 9th) is the 30th anniversary of Chairman Mao&#39;s death and today on CNN International (one of two English stations) there was a segment on Mao.&nbsp; Two different sections of the segment were blacked out and we can only guess that the government was involved.&nbsp; There was a specific woman that spoke in the segment and whenever she came on the screen, it went black.&nbsp; This appeared to be blatant media censorship right before our very eyes.</p><p>I doubt I will ever be able to reconcile the contrasts that appear in China.&nbsp; It seems to be going at light speed into the future and stumbling backward at the same time. Amazing. </p><br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/attitude" title="Sometimes I Have a Bad Attitude">Sometimes I Have a Bad Attitude</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on September 7, 2006 - 6:54pm</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>&nbsp;I have a bad attitude sometimes, particularly regarding sightseeing and the tourist experience.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s a necessary and often rewarding part of the trip, but we&rsquo;re both learning that we don&rsquo;t really <i>like </i>sightseeing.<span>&nbsp; </span>It often seems like the many of the things we see are significant because someone with dollars in their eyes decided to make it significant.<span>&nbsp; </span>Either that, or the significance that is experienced by others is lost on me.  </p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Maybe I am shallow or cynical or unsophisticated, but I will be just fine if I don&rsquo;t see another &ldquo;important&rdquo; image of The Buddha for many years.<span>&nbsp; </span>The same is true for many temples.<span>&nbsp; </span>Long before we reached <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, we started to recognize that we rarely leave a temple saying &ldquo;<i>that was so great!</i>&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>or &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m so glad we came!</i>&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>Usually it&rsquo;s more like &ldquo;Hmm, another temple.&rdquo; We call it temple fatigue.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Another example occurred just today at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Summer</st1:placename>  <st1:placetype>Palace</st1:placetype></st1:place> in <st1:city><st1:place>Beijing</st1:place></st1:city>, which is, by all accounts, an impressive sight of imperial grandeur.<span>&nbsp; </span>Inside the palace grounds (and also in the Forbidden City) there are very important rocks with names like the &ldquo;Blue Iris Stone&rdquo; which are accompanied by a story of an who emperor found the rock and had it shipped to the Palace at great expense.<span>&nbsp; </span>So there it sits, surrounded by a railing and sitting on a pedestal &ndash; a rock.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s not sculpted, it&rsquo;s not shaped, it has never been used for anything or changed in any way, it may be in the shape of something recognizable and is certainly a rockish, yellow/gray hue (despite being described as &ldquo;black and sleek&rdquo;).<span>&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that it is a rock that someone could have found at any moment in history and is one of about 1 gazillion such rocks in the world. To the admittedly undereducated like myself, it appears just as it sounds &ndash; a rock &ndash; on a pedestal - surrounded by a railing. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I&rsquo;m not sure how a rock becomes an item of Chinese culture, but many have and people quite literally line up to have their picture taken in front of it.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><font size="4"><img src="/files/includes/images/lockers-cox_f-images-china2006-china20063.jpg" border="0" height="362" width="520" /></font></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><i>(photo of the Blue Iris Stone is from <a href="http://www.soil.ncsu.edu/lockers/Cox_F/China%20tour%202006.htm">this travelouge</a>) &nbsp;</i></p><p class="MsoNormal">I have to wonder though, am I being cynical and shallow or am I being realistic?<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;ve seen it happen before in tour groups &ndash; the guide makes a big hairy deal about something and the group eats it up and prepares the cameras without thought.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is where the tourist experience blends a little too closely with dollar signs.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tour groups need sights and the more the tourist is convinced that they are seeing something significant, the more likely they&rsquo;ll actually find some significance.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, from my perspective, a strong percentage of what a tourist sees is filler &ndash; something to make the tourist feel like they are having a great experience in between the things that are really impressive and important to them. <span>&nbsp;</span>I think this gets to the heart of why I loath tour groups &ndash; too much filler and not enough time to independently figure out what is significant to me. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The tour guide is very in tune with photo taking opportunities as well. He has surely observed the hoards take pictures of a sight and assumes that everyone should have one &ndash; including me. Sometimes I snap a quick picture just to make friends but at the same time I&rsquo;m thinking &ldquo;<i>If you really want to know what I want to take a picture of, it&rsquo;s the grotesque and barely alive condition of <b>your toenails</b>, Mr. Tour Guide.&rdquo;</i></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">It reminds me of <st1:city><st1:place>Las Vegas</st1:place></st1:city> and seeing people very excited to take a picture of a replica of Michael Angelo&rsquo;s masterpiece &ldquo;David&rdquo; at Caesar&rsquo;s Palace.<span>&nbsp; </span>I just want to say to them &ldquo;<i>That is not art you know, it is not historically significant, it is a piece of plaster put here for decoration alone</i>.&rdquo; But it doesn&rsquo;t matter, they think it&rsquo;s great and who am I to judge?</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">All this is leading to the realization that I don&rsquo;t like sightseeing.<span>&nbsp; </span>I yearn for reality or a historical and observable connection to the reality of a city or country. Modern history is endlessly fascinating.<span>&nbsp; </span>The spread of Communism in <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>, Mao Zedong, Pol Pol, Ho Chi Minh&hellip; I cannot learn enough about that part of history.<span>&nbsp; </span>Anything before about 1900 becomes somewhat opaque to me.<span>&nbsp; </span>I can&rsquo;t see as much reality in it or how it is affecting a country now.<span>&nbsp; </span>What really does it for me is learning the modern realities of a place &ndash; the politics, the social issues, the transportation system, food, what locals do, say and wear day-to-day.<span>&nbsp; </span>For me, this is endlessly real and represents something that I can grasp in my view of the world. Rocks and temples?<span>&nbsp; </span>Not so much.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I will gladly continue to see sights and learn about history, but I&rsquo;ll do it recognizing that there is a curiously real, entertaining and interesting aspect of tourism and tourists that can be quite rewarding to observe, even if the sights are not.</p>    <br class="clear" />

    <p class="MsoNormal">There is a very particular and interesting type of Chinese gentleman that I&rsquo;ve been observing for a while now.<span>&nbsp; </span>He is perhaps the Chinese everyman, or the closest I can find to the type.<span>&nbsp; </span>He is an everyman in <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, but to me, the American visitor, he is quite foreign.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I do not wish to comment on his character or personality as I have not been able to communicate with him in any meaningful way.<span>&nbsp; </span>I can only comment on observing the multitudes of his kind from afar.<span>&nbsp; </span>For purposes of creating a meaningful persona, let&rsquo;s call him Chinese Bob.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/98-235735372_39501c55a3.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="393" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Chinese Bob is about 50 years old, about 5&rsquo;5&rdquo;, has a mildly receding hairline and a serious look on his roundish face, sometimes with a hint of consternation.<span>&nbsp; </span>His serious look is deceiving as he may break into boisterous laughter at any moment.<span>&nbsp; </span>His physique is rather stocky, with a plump midsection and a thick neck that extends from his ears. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I&rsquo;ve sat next to Chinese Bob in movie theaters, subways and park benches and can only describe the experience as a cavalcade of bodily noises.<span>&nbsp; </span>Bob has acute respiratory problems, causing him to groan out throat clearing half-coughs every few minutes and burp loudly without conscience.<span>&nbsp; </span>Chinese Bob can also been seen performing the very common snort-hock-spit routine on <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>&rsquo;s sidewalks, again, without conscience. <span>&nbsp;</span>This may be a symptom of his continuous smoking or general Chinese air quality.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">You might see Bob while leaving an elevator.<span>&nbsp; </span>He will be part of the group rushing into the elevator before you have time to get out. On the streets of <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, you might recognize Bob on a hot day by his exposed belly &ndash; he may be the one walking around with his shirt rolled up from the bottom or unbuttoned completely.<span>&nbsp; </span><br /><img src="/files/includes/images/62-223705747_41b584d6ff.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The one tried-and-true method of identifying Chinese Bob is by his footwear.<span>&nbsp; </span>Bob always wears the same shoes and socks.<span>&nbsp; </span>They are pointy-toed dress shoes with very thin, light-colored socks.<span>&nbsp; </span>You might even see Bob wear these shoes with athletic shorts as he ambles down the street with his posture laid back and his feet flopping forward.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/67-216459407_d09568a382.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">The other sure way to identify Chinese Bob is by watching him talk on a mobile phone.<span>&nbsp; </span>Actually, it&rsquo;s not something you observe so much as hear.<span>&nbsp; </span>Bob will seem to be yelling into his mobile phone without regard for his location. You can picture him saying &ldquo;<i>BIG BUSINESS HERE.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m talking BIG business everyone, BIG TIME.</i>&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>Bob is quite a big talker, I imagine.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I also imagine that Bob is a family man and a dedicated worker.<span>&nbsp; </span>Despite his foreignness and actions that sometimes seem repulsive to me, I know that Chinese Bob, if I could talk to him, would be a friendly and helpful person who might try to convince me to have a cigarette with him as he tells me about English football, Yao Ming and the upcoming Beijing Olympics.<span>&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately though, I don&rsquo;t speak Mandarin Chinese so I can only assume that, on observation alone, he finds me equally or more foreign and strange.</p>  <br class="clear" />
