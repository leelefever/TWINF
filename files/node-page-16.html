Indeed, <st1:city><st1:place>Phnom Penh</st1:place></st1:city> was the center of the <a href="/47/khmer-rouge">Khmer Rouge</a> &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; that left over 1 million Cambodians dead. While a majority of the deaths occurred through starvation, malnourishment and poor medical care, thousands died at the hands of Khmer Rouge soldiers.<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region> has created two genocide memorials that make up two parts of the machination of death implemented by Pol Pot.  </p><st1:place><st1:city></st1:city></st1:place>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leelefever/181256468/"><img src="/files/includes/images/74-181256468_9b7ac2489b_m.jpg" align="left" height="180" width="240" /></a>&nbsp; <br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leelefever/181257350/"><img src="/files/includes/images/48-181257350_097502990a_m.jpg" height="180" width="240" />  </a></p><p class="MsoNormal">The first memorial is a former school that was turned into a prison when schools were outlawed.<span>&nbsp; </span>The prison was called &ldquo;S-21&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tuol Sleng&rdquo; and it played a central role in the identification and execution of those accused of treason within the Khmer Rouge itself.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of the over 20,000 people sent to the prison, only 7-12 reportedly survived.&nbsp;</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/61-181256724_ffe1cf0137.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /><o:p> <br /></o:p></p>      <p class="MsoNormal">Pol Pot and the others running the show became increasingly paranoid and convinced that CIA and KGB agents were operating within their ranks. Unbelievable means of torture were used to bring out &ldquo;confessions&rdquo; including electricity, mutilation and burning. The accused were forced to name other &ldquo;spies&rdquo; and faced a choice of naming other innocent people or dying. This created a vicious circle of needless death as these soldiers named one another in an attempt to save their own lives.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the end of course, all involved were executed.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/77-181257778_8d4847d6f8.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p class="MsoNormal">Many of the deaths actually occurred at what is now known as the &ldquo;Killing Fields&rdquo; which are mass graves about 30 minutes outside of <st1:city><st1:place>Phnom   Penh</st1:place></st1:city>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Perhaps the darkest of the sites I&rsquo;ve visited, the Killing Fields offers an absolutely chilling experience of walking across mass graves where the soil is littered with human bones and clothes of victims.<span>&nbsp; </span>Signs are posted by trees that say things like &ldquo;Killing tree against which soldiers beat children&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mass grave of 166 victims without heads&rdquo;.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/files/includes/images/60-181257536_862aeadae6.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;While these memorials are sad, gruesome and effective, I think it is a bit unfortunate that Cambodia is known more for genocide than it&#39;s <a href="/47/dispatch/2006/07/07/a-holiday-in-cambodia">beautiful beaches</a>, <a href="/47/kabal_chai">waterfalls</a> or incredible ancient ruins.&nbsp; I&#39;m seeing a nation on the rebound who is ready to shed all the baggage and move on. <br /></p><br class="clear" />

  <p>I sometimes feel like we&#39;re talking a bit too much about our activities and not so much about our experience, if you know what I mean.&nbsp; We aim to change that a bit, but for now, an experience we had yesterday deserves a little publication.</p><p>Don is a friendly Irish ex-pat that runs Coaster&#39;s Bungalows where we&#39;re staying in Sihanoukville.&nbsp; Yesterday, Don saw me on our balcony and said, in his Irish accent &quot;Hey! Are you leaving today?&nbsp; We&#39;re going out to the waterfall, if you wanna go, meet us at the bar in 30.&quot;&nbsp; Waterfall?&nbsp; We had not heard about the waterfall!&nbsp; Upon looking at the guidebooks (Footprint and Rough Guide), no waterfall is mentioned.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/69-185252759_7568e20f61.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>As it turned out, we got to follow along on a waterfall trip with Don and his family (wife Carrie and daughter Anna).&nbsp; After driving for about 30 minutes (including a &quot;shortcut&quot; through barely passable roads&quot;) we went down a long dirt road that ended at some shacks and a washed out bridge.&nbsp; After being ferried over the river we came upon a waterfall, or actually a set of waterfalls that were certainly among the best I&#39;ve ever seen.  Given a little more care and infrastructure, the falls have the potential to become a national landmark- they are that impressive. &nbsp; <br /></p><p>&nbsp;Situated at the convergence of two rivers, the water falls fall into a basin that appears to have dropped about 10 meters all at once, creating a valley where you are surrounded by waterfalls from two rivers.&nbsp; Stunning.</p><p>The highlight is a set of falls that flow off an outcropping, enabling people to climb behind it in short ledges. What a weird feeling.&nbsp; It&#39;s a bit like the first time you snorkle and your body has to learn that it can, indeed, breathe underwater.&nbsp; With water flowing over your eyes and mouth and crashing over your head, threatening to grab you and slam you on the rocks below, the experience is a more than a bit breathtaking.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/78-185251641_1ba0a35f5c.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/71-185250155_bc40a60962.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Water rushing by overhead...<br /></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/63-185250029_7e9f45ce1f.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Don, our guide for the day... </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/66-185250294_455b542267.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/78-185249922_1cc046ec6d.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>If you want to visit the Kabal Chai falls, ask about it at the guesthouses in Sihanoukville.&nbsp; It is best in the rainy season for obvious reasons and the rivers dwindle to a trickle in the dry season. </p><br class="clear" />

  <p class="MsoNormal">Since <st1:country-region><st1:place>Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region> became an imminent part of our itinerary, I have had the Dead Kennedy&rsquo;s song &ldquo;<st1:place>Holiday</st1:place> in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region>&rdquo; playing a soundtrack in the back of mind.</p>  <br />  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana" class="blockquote">It&#39;s time to taste what you most fear<br /> Right Guard will not help you here<br /> Brace yourself, my dear <br /> <br /> It&#39;s a holiday in Cambodia<br /> It&#39;s tough kid, but it&#39;s life<br /> It&#39;s a holiday in Cambodia<br /> Don&#39;t forget to pack a wife</span></p>      <p class="MsoNormal">The song was published in 1980, just a year after the failure of the Khmer Rouge regime and reflects some of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region>&rsquo;s reputation from the time (<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deadkennedys/holidayincambodia.html">full song lyrics</a>). I think it is safe to say that <st1:country-region><st1:place>Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region> has come a long way since 1980, which was the nadir of its backward progress.&nbsp; </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">A holiday in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region> can now be taken with no irony whatsoever.

However, we were impressed with <st1:country-region><st1:place>Laos</st1:place></st1:country-region> overall &ndash; it was full of scenic beauty and the traveling was easier than we expected. between Luang Prabang, Vang Vieng, and <st1:city><st1:place>Vientiane</st1:place></st1:city>. While we enjoyed the day trips to waterfalls and river rafting, the day&rsquo;s end would bring a search for dinner in the towns.   </p>  <p class="MsoNormal">As we walked by each restaurant and caf&eacute;, staff would inevitably not smile, but would instead stare to see if we chose one of their tables for a meal. Once we sat down, a menu was silently dropped in front of us and the server stood, still without a smile, staring to hear a request. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">We understand that cultural cues can be very different between neighboring countries and we assume that restaurant staff in general didn&rsquo;t feel we were an imposition on their evening, but after coming from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region> &ndash; the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Land</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Smiles</st1:placename></st1:place> &ndash; we had to remind ourselves not to feel rushed to order and eat.<span>&nbsp; </span>The service was good and the Lao we met were kind and courteous, but often lacked the appearance of smiling friendliness.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">In other Asian countries, I hadn&rsquo;t felt that need to fall back on Western food, but the local Lao dishes for me seemed to lack much flavor with the exception of straight chilli peppers. We tried more than a few stir fried dishes, curries, spring rolls, meat and sticky rice on sticks, and a few handfuls of market favorites wrapped in banana leaves. It wasn&rsquo;t nearly as delicious as Thai versions.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even the dipping sauces seemed watery and lacked the salty or sweet richness in flavor the spring rolls needed, though fresh mint added to the rolls were a nice touch. I can see why, at least for foreigners, there were many more cooking schools available for Thai cuisine.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">In <st1:city><st1:place>Vientiane</st1:place></st1:city>, we ate well with French and Italian cuisine mixed in with a few Lao meals. It was a little embarrassing as we perceived our choices as those of &ldquo;weak&rdquo; travellers, but we greatly anticipated European food that wasn&rsquo;t Spaghetti in tomato sauce. So, in the end, <st1:city><st1:place>Vientiane</st1:place></st1:city>&rsquo;s lamb shank and caviar-salmon ravioli meals with smiling staff (3 course meals for 2 under US$10-12) were my favorites.</p>  <br class="clear" />

  <p>After India, even places known for unsanitary conditions seem all the more worry-free.&nbsp; This may have been the case with Laos, which was much nicer than I expected, but lacks infrastructure nonetheless.&nbsp; We jettisoned the hand sanitizing lotion in Thailand/Japan and did not look back. Perhaps we should have as we&#39;ve both been laid low by minor ailments lately.&nbsp; Just a little head cold and some digestive troubles to welcome us to Cambodia.</p><p>I&#39;m hoping Sachi will have some words for you about Laos soon, but in the mean time, I&#39;d like to talk about currency.&nbsp; First of all, I didn&#39;t realize until we were already there that Laos (or the People&#39;s Democratic Republic of Laos) is a communist country with an almost free-market enconomy (a bit like China).&nbsp; Anyway, much like Cambodia, multiple currencies can be used.&nbsp; The Lao &quot;kip&quot; is joined with the US Dollar and the Thai Baht.&nbsp; There are 10,000 kip for each American dollar, making for wallet-bulging stacks of change.&nbsp; </p><p>Officially, the Lao government says that the Kip is the only and required currency.&nbsp; However, Lao Airlines, the government-owned carrier will <i>only</i> accept payment in US dollars.&nbsp; Such is the state of affairs in Laos.</p><p>Here in Cambodia, the defacto currency is the US Dollar ($1 to about 4000r).&nbsp; The Cambodian Riel is often given for change to the dollar, but at a grocery store today I noticed a cash register that looked just as it would at home- stocked with US money.  I used 10 minutes (US$.20) of Internet time today, payed with a one dollar bill and received 8 bills of change back in the Cambodian Riel.&nbsp; Wallet bulging.</p><p>I fulfilled a couple of my trip-long goals today by visiting the Killing Fields and the Tuol Seng Prinson here in Phnom Penh, both big parts of the murderous Khmer Rouge regime in 1975-1979.&nbsp; I&#39;ll have a lot to say about that soon. </p><br class="clear" />
