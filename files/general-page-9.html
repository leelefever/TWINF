      <h2><a href="/holland" title="Sex and Drugs in Liberal Holland">Sex and Drugs in Liberal Holland</a></h2>
    <div class="info">By: leelefever on October 14, 2006 - 3:58am</div>
    <div class="content">
  <p>I described Amsterdam to my Mom as &quot;A bastion of hedonism&quot;.&nbsp; Sure, it has beautiful canals, nice people, amazing sights, about a billion bicycles and a ton of charm, but what is truly impressive about Amsterdam and what differentiates it on a worldwide scale is the liberal policies of the Dutch government concerning drugs and prostitution.</p><p>For instance, we stayed in a guesthouse in the Red Light District and within two blocks of our guesthouse, anyone with the money can <i>legally</i> buy &quot;soft drugs&quot; like marijuana, mushrooms and hashish in small quantities and sexual services from a host of licensed prostitutes who display their wares in large windows under red lights.&nbsp; I suppose you could also see some music and complete the hedonists triumverate of sex, drugs <i>and</i> rock-n-roll.</p><p>The view from our place:</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/108-269097325_1760c0157f.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="500" width="375" /></p><p>Coming from George W.&#39;s America, this all seems quite surreal. Surely these things must be causing all sorts of social ills. As it turns out, the Dutch policy is quite calculated and appears to be surprisingly healthy for the country compared to other EU countries.&nbsp;</p><p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_the_Netherlands">wikipedia</a>:</p><p><span class="blockquote">Most policymakers in the Netherlands believe that if a problem has proved to be unsolvable, it is better to try controlling it instead of continuing to enforce laws with mixed results.</span>This means that the sale of sex and drugs are regulated and taxed, ensuring as much safety as possible and that the government can benefit from the revenue.&nbsp; Further, it means that the government can exert control when it is needed. But, what about drug abuse?&nbsp; Doesn&#39;t the availability increase the instances of abuse?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently not.&nbsp; Through <a href="http://stats05.emcdda.europa.eu/en/elements/gpstab08a-en.html">studies completed</a> across the EU since 2000, The Netherlands ranks 7th in the use of marijuana - after Cyprus Spain, the UK, France, Germany and Italy.&nbsp; The prevalance is similar for other <a href="http://stats05.emcdda.europa.eu/en/elements/gpstab09a-en.html">types of drugs</a>. </p><p>For the visitor to Amsterdam, these elements of the city can be surprising and intimidating - we talked to some people who would not step foot into the Red Light District. However, I think it is more surprising that the city doesn&#39;t have the overall feel of a &quot;bad neighborhood&quot; with a high frequency of drugs, sex shops and prostitutes.&nbsp; There is a ragged and depressing element to the Red Light District, but I don&#39;t think it is much different than any other city - it is just that tourists are exposed and invited to participate in activities that would otherwise be managed in dark alleys and controlled by criminals instead of government agencies. <br /></p><p>The Dutch policy seems based on the idea that people are going to do what they are going to do, regardless of the government or the potential for punishment.&nbsp; And if this is true, their only tools are regulation, taxation and tolerance.&nbsp; It makes sense to me and the Dutch folks we talked to about it.   </p><br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/boomchicago" title="Me, MySpace and iPod: Delightfully Geeky">Me, MySpace and iPod: Delightfully Geeky</a></h2>
    <div class="info">By: leelefever on October 12, 2006 - 8:17am</div>
    <div class="content">
  <p>I knew it would be interesting at least- a standup/improv comedy troupe called <a href="http://www.boomchicago.nl/">Boom Chicago</a> doing a show called &quot;Me, MySpace and iPod&quot;.&nbsp; As it turned out, it was completely up my alley and I was very impressed. </p><p>It was the first I had seen a comedy routine integrated with technology and social networking - something very close to <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/">my job</a> when I&#39;m not traveling.&nbsp; </p><p>For instance, they asked the audience who had a page on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace.com</a> and someone was chosen for the skit. They went to the live site during the show to check out the guy&#39;s page and asked him about some friends on his friend&#39;s list.&nbsp; Then, later in the show they did a whole routine that brought his MySpace friends to life based on his descriptions.&nbsp; So freaking funny - and for the skit to work every night they have to find someone in the audience with a MySpace page - in Amsterdam. This goes to show how huge MySpace is.</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/94-267894941_b4320ead1d.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>They also did a skit based on <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/">Wikipedia</a>, which is an online encyclopedia that a very large community of people manage by editing pages.&nbsp; Wikipedia works, but is also famous for disagreements about how an entry should be written.&nbsp; In the skit, they ask for an object, in this case a pineapple and they take turns describing it in encyclopedic style.&nbsp; When one performer disagrees, they yell &quot;EDIT!&quot; and it becomes their turn to create the &quot;real&quot; definition.&nbsp; Wiki-based humor, wow.</p><p>Being that we are in Amsterdam, they also parodied Anne Frank and showed a YouTube style video blog that was done by Anne Frank back on the 1940&#39;s [<a href="http://www.boomchicago.nl/en/news-and-images/videos/index.cfm?i=2513">watch the video</a>].&nbsp; It was a take-off of the now-famous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ87kBN0Nhk">LonelyGirl15 on You Tube</a>.</p><p>I was in awe. It was funny yes, but what really blew me away was that these websites and ideas were too geeky for prime time only a couple of years ago and now, suddenly, it is mainstream enough to become fodder for an entire comedy show.&nbsp; If I was running a technology conference, I would hire Boom Chicago in a second. </p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on October 8, 2006 - 10:58pm</div>
    <div class="content">
  <p>With this post I&#39;m adding a new tag to the &quot;filed under&quot; list:&nbsp; &quot;goinghome&quot;. Our thoughts are increasingly looking to the end of the trip.&nbsp; We still have a couple of months which is a lot of time, but it really feels like home is just around the corner.&nbsp; The inevitable transition into a normal working life has been a big topic of discussion and one that we wish could wait another 6 months.&nbsp; We&#39;ve also been considering what to do with this web site when we&#39;re finished. We&#39;re considering coming to a hard stop at the end of the year so we don&#39;t just fade away.<br /></p><p>Two friends that we met on the Trans-Siberian train are at the very end of a mammoth 400+ days across 40+ countries.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.globenotes.com/Diary.aspx?usr=175&amp;log=101">Kathy and Sharon</a> are back in the UK and only days away from home.&nbsp; They remind us of the mix of excitement and sadness of going home.&nbsp; Check out <a href="http://www.globenotes.com/Diary.aspx?usr=175&amp;log=101">their site</a>- a truly incredible trip.</p><p>&nbsp;Alas we have a lot to think about now - like making it to Amsterdam today and meeting our Seattle friends Josh and Betty.&nbsp; Yup - mainland Europe and hopefully a respite from the ridiculous prices we&#39;ve found in Scandinavia.&nbsp; Sachi has never been to Europe, so I think the last phase of the trip will be some of the European basics - and some rest.&nbsp; We&#39;ve been moving constantly - every 2 days for weeks and it&#39;ll be nice to settle in for a week or so and regroup for the final push. &nbsp;</p><p>Besides the whole city being sold out of hotel rooms thanks to a soccer match, Copenhagen was awesome.&nbsp; One of the most interesting things to us is how diverse the populations are becoming as we move into mainland Europe.&nbsp; For most of the trip we&#39;ve been in mostly homogenous societies (at least in appearance) - India, SE Asia, China, Japan, Russia, Scandinavia; everyone looks the same.&nbsp; Suddenly, it seems strange to see such diversity - and a little more like home.&nbsp; Did I mention home again?</p><p>Here are a couple of photos from Copenhagen...</p><p>&nbsp;This is &quot;Nyhavn&quot; - quite touristy, but also very&nbsp; cool.<img src="/files/includes/images/85-264783679_beb019a688.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="136" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;One more from there...<br /><img src="/files/includes/images/117-264783792_9d6d18e623.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="145" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Copenhagen has great cobblestone pedestrian walkways throughout the old city.</p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/101-264780252_255020fc22.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><br class="clear" />

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on October 6, 2006 - 7:47am</div>
    <div class="content">
  <p>Put simply, Norway&#39;s Lofoten Islands are surely the most stunning mountain scenery we&#39;ve ever experienced. I&#39;ll let the pictures and a few anecdotes tell the story...<img src="/files/includes/images/106-262276424_07090944fb.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="170" width="500" /></p><p>We stayed in a tiny fishing village called Henningsvaer,or <font size="-1">Henningsv&aelig;r, if you want to be accurate.&nbsp; Our <a href="http://www.henningsvar-rorbuer.no/engelsk/home.htm">lodging</a> for three nights was a &quot;rorbu&quot;, which is a fisherman&#39;s cabin redone for visitors.&nbsp; It was low season, so we got it for half price for three nights (USD$80 per night). It had a kitchen, a view over the water, four beds and low doorways - as my head would tell you.&nbsp; Our expectations were exceeded from the start.</font></p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/79-262096742_10ef5ec16d.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;Having a kitchen was nice because Norway is obscenely expensive: $8 dollars to rent a DVD, $10 for a pint of beer at a restaurant.&nbsp; We ate meatballs and noodles at &quot;home&quot;.&nbsp; Speaking of home, this was the view out of the back.<br /><img src="/files/includes/images/111-262276370_12c7b6b4de.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="200" width="500" /> <br /></p><p>&nbsp;and from the side...</p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/99-262096892_33dcd46b58.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;The little town of <font size="-1">Henningsv&aelig;r, is called &quot;the Venice of the Lofotens&quot;.

Beautiful and desolate. Hardly encoutered a soul. If you get a chance to stop at Svolvaer, there&#39;s is a little bar just as you enter the harbour that serves FREE fiskesoup at ungodly hours in the summer (no one really sleeps anyway), subdued ambiance, smoke, beer, the lost world.

  <p> It's funny how things tend to work out. Sometimes a tiny bit of information can turn into something wonderful. Without <a href="http://members.virtualtourist.com/m/tp/14dc5b/">this helpful post</a>, it's likely that we would have made other plans and not gone north at all.  As it turned out, our decision to keep moving northward turned into a highlight of the whole trip. Thank you Internet!</p>

<p> This video is from two days of exploring the Lofoten Islands via car.  Despite being a couple of hundred miles into the Arctic Circle, it is quite mild thanks to the gulf stream current. A stunningly beautiful place our jaws are still on the floor. Pictures and more info coming soon...</p>

  <p>&nbsp;It took us 4 busses and 3 trains to do it, but we have finally arrived in Narvik, Norway, from Helsinki, Finland - the starting point for exploring the Lofoten Islands and fjords via rental car over the next few days. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A533125">Narvik</a> is a cool little town that has the northernmost train station (and supposedly disco) in the world.

Going from Asia to Norway seems like traversing planets instead of the same land mass.

  <p>Since I&#39;ve met Lee, he&#39;s had a dreamy look in his eyes when he describes cold places above the Arctic Circle. Our overnight train leaves for Rovaniemi, a town 6 miles from the Arctic Circle, in a few hours and we&#39;re both excited to head north. However, we&#39;re not sure what we will do after we cross it. Readily available summer transportation has slowed its frequency at this time of year, and some ferries and busses may not be running at all in the Northern wilderness of Finland and Norway.&nbsp;</p><p>We are just going to arrive, head to the tourist office and see what lodges or cottages we can get to and talk to local folks from there. We might be heading to the fjords and Lofoten Islands of Northern Norway, or we might be heading right back to Helsinki. Either way, we&#39;ll see some reindeer, the <a href="http://www.santaclaus.fi/?deptid=8044">official Santa</a> and soon-to-be-frozen lakes along the way.&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />
