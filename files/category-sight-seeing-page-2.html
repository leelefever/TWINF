    <div class="content">

  <p>An early morning trek to the top of the outer crater of Mount Bromo, in Eastern Java, produced the most amazing photography of my trip.&nbsp; Mount Bromo actually is a steaming active&nbsp; volcano situated in a large outer crater, and is part of a chain of still active volcanoes on Java.</p><p>&nbsp;During the day, the outer&nbsp;crater is an ashen moonscape in which sits a somewhat ghostly Hindu Temple.&nbsp; </p><p><img src="/files/includes/images/47-system-files-file-mount_bromo_day_s.jpg" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, in the early hours of the morning, mist fills the outer crater transforming this moonscape into a stunning lake of cloud from which emerges the inner crater, often giving off quite a bit of steam.&nbsp; In the background, another volcano in the chain lets fly some ash.&nbsp; </p><p><img src="http://theworldisnotflat.com/47/system/files?file=Mount_Bromo_dawn_s.jpg" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I shot about 12 pictures and got three or four nice ones, of which this is the real stunner of the bunch.&nbsp; My scanner is not so hot, but hopefully it will not interfere with what you see.</p><p>Steve</p><br class="clear" />

  <p>My wife and I have been through the Netherlands twice.&nbsp; If you're in the vicinity of Amsterdam, check out the windmills at Zaanse Schanse, just northwest of the city.&nbsp; Its easily accessibly by train and you can see a few working windmills.&nbsp; Check out the mustard grinding windmill, we bought a bottle and wish we had purchased more!&nbsp; Southeast of Amsterdam is Utrecht, a much smaller and slower town than Amsterdam, still built on canals.&nbsp; Spend a day there wandering around.&nbsp; If its market day, you can pick up cheaps eats such as local cheeses, bread, pastries, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the southern end of Holland, squished between Belgium and Germany is Maastricht, a small college town spanning the Maas river.&nbsp; We spent a day there enjoying the friendly atmosphere while trying some local food and drink.&nbsp; Maastricht is very laid back and a great place to stop if you're in Koln (Cologne), Germany which is just across the border.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy!&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />

  The most memorable place I ever visited was the 99 islands of Langkawi, Malaysia, my brother was sailing around the world and got stuck there, so I went out for 3 weeks and we sailed around the islands,fantastic scenery, untouched beaches and very few people except in the main town of Kuah on the only inhabited island, and they were very friendly and welcoming, a good sidenote is the place is duty free, as it's where the Malaysians, including the Royals, go for their holidays.<br /><br class="clear" />

  I spent three weeks in Brazil this year and the highlight of my trip has to have been Bonito.&nbsp; It is an eco tourism town located in the west of Brazil near Campo Grande.&nbsp; We stayed in the youth hostel <a href="http://www.ajbonito.com.br/" title="www.ajbonito.com.br">www.ajbonito.com.br</a> and organised all the trips through them.&nbsp; You have to snorkle down Rio de Prata and if your feeling a bit daring then the Abismo Anhuma is a thrilling 72 meter abseil down into a cave followed snorkelling or diving in clean water inside a cave. The food in the hostel is great value and really good homecooked Brazilian fare.<br /><br class="clear" />

  <div>There's more to Japan than Tokyo and Kyoto. :)</div><div><div><div>Here are some suggestions for 1-3 Day trips&nbsp;that will get you out of the cities and let you experience the country and culture.</div><div><div><div><u>Miyajima Island</u></div><div>This island is just a short train and ferry ride away from Hiroshima and deserves it's fame as one of the 3 most beautiful places in Japan.&nbsp; It's home to some beautiful temples and alot of wild deer.&nbsp; I was lucky enough to be there just as the fall leaves were turning colours and it was easily the most beautiful spot on the trip</div><div><div><div><div><u>Takayama</u></div><div>It's like a minature kyoto. There's an amazing traditional market place as well as an early morning farmers' market along the river. The Hida village is fun to ramble around and on some days you get the chance to meet people practicing traditional crafts.</div><div><div><div><u>Hakone</u></div><div>There's a Hakone free pass you can buy that allows you access to the Buses, ferries, trains, and cablecars in the area. The area is a great place to explore for a few days. The's an open air museum, the sulpher springs on a nearby mountain, a beautiful shrine in Hakone-machi, the ferries on lake Ashi-no-ko, and 2 possible views of Mt Fuji (weather permitting)</div><div><div><div><u>Naruko Onsen</u></div><div>Getting to Naruko is a little tricky (you have to leave the shinkansen lines and start travelling by local trains). But it's worth it: The hotsprings are marvellous.&nbsp; There are some beautiful hiking trails, a wooden doll museum and several ski hills nearby.</div><div><div><u>Yamadera</u></div><div>This collection of temples is built on a mountain side in Yamagata prefecture. Climbing up is a little tough but the view is spectacular.&nbsp; The area is also famous for a Haiku by Bashou: Stillness. Penetrating the Rocks.

      <h2><a href="/blog/jacques3b/ypres-the-somme" title="Ypres &amp; the Somme">Ypres &amp; the Somme</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: Jacques3b on October 12, 2005 - 8:22am</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p>Ypres &amp; the Somme <a href="/files/includes/images/blogger-7350-1680-1600-24-09-05_19251.jpg"></a>We travelled over to Paris Beauvais by Ryanair on Saturday 24th - the flight is at 7:15 so we arrived at Watsons Ayr Park just after 5:30 and were slightly miffed to just miss a bus due to &quot;processing&quot;. However, the check in queues were minimal and we reached Beauvais uneventfully to find a very long queue to collect the car from Hertz, it took almost an hour to collect a pre-booked hire car ! Next time we go this way, I will book with National/Citer - they have an office there and have always been OK in the UK. Not sure why, but I need to check why the Hertz hire in Spring, from Poitiers, cost &pound;259 versus last week, from Beauvais, which was about &pound;150. The rental this time was a very boxy Opel Meriva - basically a Corsa pretending to be an MPV - I would rather have had the Corsa.The journey from Beauvais to Ypres was relatively easy - although via Michelin instructions were wrong, recommending the wrong turning in Armentiers (we did not see the Mademoiselle !! ) - but after a stop for lunch in a very average pub, we thoroughly enjoyed the Flanders museum. When I addressed the landlady in the pub in my best French, she asked if I was British - quite interesting, usually they ask if we are English although I also recall being asked if we were Irish during this week.Back to the Flanders Museum, in the Cloth Hall which is the very centre of Ypres. This hall was qualified as the largest non-religious Gothic building in Europe !! My generation expects to go to a museum and look at a lot of artefacts in glass cases. I am way out of date. This one was very interactive, lots of PCs with slide shows, lots of video, music, noise, poetry being read &amp; so on - it was excellent, very professional especially the way everything was presented in 4 languages. The Ariane hotel was pleasant - would have liked to stay there more than one night.Walking over to the Menin Gate - actually R insisted that we drive part of the way - and came across a pipe band from Leyton who all seemed to have SE.UK accents. They were due to perform the 8pm ceremony at Menin Gate which was excellent, though they do need a bit more practice, especially of Amazing Grace. That particular rendition reminded us again of the shot of L. at her wedding when the piper was &ldquo;playing&rdquo;.At Menin Gate, every night at 8:00 the last post is played. On that night, there was a huge crowd, a number of wreaths were layed, the pipers played and the last post was done on trumpets. The atmosphere was sombre but amicable.The Menin Gate is a British (or Commonwealth) memorial so there was a focus on GB, but it was spoiled a bit when some jingoistic idiot (this editor needs a thesaurus !! ) started God Save the Queen. This is fine if you are English (I presume they like it), but if you are Scottish and, particularly from a Catholic background it is actually very offensive because it is used as an offensive weapon in Glasgow and other parts of Scotland by militant Protestants and Orangeman in a forcefully anti Catholic manner. That said, it was an interesting ceremony, very well attended with lots of youngsters. The Great War was over 90 years ago; becoming ancient history and difficult to imagine now.We ate at a small pizza restaurant nearby and tried Hoogarden beer - delicious. All the locals seem to speak excellent English. Although I am officially off the beer - too much Guinness too often when I was working in Dublin and do need to lose some girth &amp; weight - I enjoyed 3 bottles and must try to get some for the party time at Xmas &amp; see if the others like it as much. BTW, S. does not know where in Belgium James is now living !I liked the ramparts at Ypres, apparently you could walk from the Menin Gate to the Lille Gate around the ramparts.(Ypres or Ieper is actually in Belgium !)</p>

  We try to visit as many botanic gardens as possible, if we visit a place. The Brisbane Botanic Gardens is again another nice example, with lots of palmtrees and large bamboos, and even mangrove boardwalks, along the Brisbane River.<br class="clear" />

  At the West-Coast (also known as 'Wet-Coast'), make sure you wear insect repellent against the sandflies, as they can give nasty bites, which will bug you for days.<br class="clear" />

  <div align="left">You might have booked a scenic flight, boat trip,&hellip; which are weather dependent. The weather is very unpredictable in NZ! Try to have a bad weather replacement activity in case the trip gets cancelled. And try to have at least 2 days at those locations, so you might be able to do the trip the next day&hellip; We had 4 out of 7 excursions cancelled because of the weather, including a glacier heli-walk and an active vulcano walk .</div> <br class="clear" />
