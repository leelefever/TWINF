Sachi, the lucky, found that a couple of layers of skin had been worn away.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is not a good way to start a two day train ride.<o:p></o:p></span>  </p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black"></span>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">From the moment we stepped on the train, we were focused on the upcoming border ordeal with </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">Russia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">, famous for its 11 hour wait.<span>&nbsp; </span>The waiting around was not so bad except that the bathrooms on the train are locked for a majority of the time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course, this is because the toilet dumps directly onto the tracks below, potentially making the already sketchy border area a sewer as well.<span>&nbsp; </span>Our goal was bladder management, but just in case, we are holding a couple of plastic bottles in reserve.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">We knew we were supposed to arrive at the border at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="4"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">4AM</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black"> so we both got up at </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="3"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">3:30AM</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black"> to do what we could in the last minutes of the unlocked toilet.<span>&nbsp; </span>The train arrived, the toilets were locked and we were left alone for 4 hours until </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="8"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">8AM</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">, when the wait began for the border guards to arrive and take our passports for processing.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">For the entire train journey to this point, we operated only in the moment - by necessity.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was no train itinerary and the attendants only communicated in very basic terms.<span>&nbsp; </span>So we sat and waited and looked for our fellow passengers to appear on the platform - a sure sign that we can leave the train for a brief moment.<span>&nbsp; </span>Other than that we just asked &quot;Can we get off?&quot; and then try to figure out if the answer was a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &quot;no&rdquo;. Our fellow Western travelers were in a similar predicament.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">The border crossing into </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">Russia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black"> was done with little fanfare.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, someone presented himself soon after the border that was a bit startling for us.<span>&nbsp; </span>For the first time in 8 months, a government representative had blonde hair and blue eyes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Over a few minutes it was clear that the border with </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">Mongolia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black"> seems to represent the most genetically distinct border we&#39;ve crossed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Within about two kilometers the people became, very, very Russian.<span>&nbsp; </span>From what we&#39;d seen thus far, the Russians are quite beautiful people with bright eyes, distinct features and slim physiques.<span>&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">Just before stopping at customs an Asian women entered our berth and hung a jacket on a hook and walked away as if we would be happy to carry the jacket with us through customs. Sachi promptly hung it outside where she collected it quickly.&nbsp; <span></span>Shaaah, as if. <o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black"><span>&nbsp;</span>Counting the </span><st1:time hour="4" minute="0"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">4am</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black"> arrival at the Mongolian border and 2 hours of free time on the Russian side, the ordeal did take about 11 hours and no plastic bottles were needed.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, I will never forget an event just before departure that almost made me mess my pants.<span>&nbsp; </span>A group of 5 of us left the train station to visit a shop about 500 yards from the station and we left with over an hour before our </span><st1:time hour="15" minute="0"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">3PM</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black"> departure time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Our quest was successful and we came back to the station with vodka bottles in hand - but something important was missing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Our train was not sight.<span>&nbsp; </span>We rushed up to the platform and looked around as if it might be camouflaged somehow - but no train was on track number 2.<span>&nbsp; </span>Soon after we also realized that all five of us lacked any necessary means to catch another train.<span>&nbsp; </span>We had all left for the store without a passport, train ticket, extra money or credit cards.<span>&nbsp; </span>For a fleeting moment, our world and prospects for recovery seemed quite bleak and I wondered how I would be reunited with Sachi, clearly on her way into </span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">Siberia</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black"> without me.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, to our surprise we saw a train approaching from the opposite direction and soon after a woman we recognized.<span>&nbsp; </span>Was this our train?<span>&nbsp; </span>Looking in the window, I met eyes with Sachi on the train, smiling and shaking her head.<span>&nbsp; </span>She, along with the other passengers in our car were also surprised and briefly concerned when the train suddenly departed.<span>&nbsp; </span>As it turns out, it only left the station briefly to change tracks and there was much relief.<span>&nbsp; </span>Never again will I leave a train without extra money, a passport and ticket. <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <br class="clear" />

  <p>The train trip has exceeded our expectations in a big way.  The train itself is OK, but Mongolia and Siberia have been highlights of the whole trip, except for my saddle sores.  Unfortunately though, it's a bit harder to upload all the pictures, videos, etc. Once we get into the big cities like Moscow we'll be sharing a lot more. Here is quick video to get started...</p>

    <div class="content">
  <p>&nbsp;I have a bad attitude sometimes, particularly regarding sightseeing and the tourist experience.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s a necessary and often rewarding part of the trip, but we&rsquo;re both learning that we don&rsquo;t really <i>like </i>sightseeing.<span>&nbsp; </span>It often seems like the many of the things we see are significant because someone with dollars in their eyes decided to make it significant.<span>&nbsp; </span>Either that, or the significance that is experienced by others is lost on me.  </p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Maybe I am shallow or cynical or unsophisticated, but I will be just fine if I don&rsquo;t see another &ldquo;important&rdquo; image of The Buddha for many years.<span>&nbsp; </span>The same is true for many temples.<span>&nbsp; </span>Long before we reached <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, we started to recognize that we rarely leave a temple saying &ldquo;<i>that was so great!</i>&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>or &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m so glad we came!</i>&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>Usually it&rsquo;s more like &ldquo;Hmm, another temple.&rdquo; We call it temple fatigue.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Another example occurred just today at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Summer</st1:placename>  <st1:placetype>Palace</st1:placetype></st1:place> in <st1:city><st1:place>Beijing</st1:place></st1:city>, which is, by all accounts, an impressive sight of imperial grandeur.<span>&nbsp; </span>Inside the palace grounds (and also in the Forbidden City) there are very important rocks with names like the &ldquo;Blue Iris Stone&rdquo; which are accompanied by a story of an who emperor found the rock and had it shipped to the Palace at great expense.<span>&nbsp; </span>So there it sits, surrounded by a railing and sitting on a pedestal &ndash; a rock.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s not sculpted, it&rsquo;s not shaped, it has never been used for anything or changed in any way, it may be in the shape of something recognizable and is certainly a rockish, yellow/gray hue (despite being described as &ldquo;black and sleek&rdquo;).<span>&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that it is a rock that someone could have found at any moment in history and is one of about 1 gazillion such rocks in the world. To the admittedly undereducated like myself, it appears just as it sounds &ndash; a rock &ndash; on a pedestal - surrounded by a railing. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I&rsquo;m not sure how a rock becomes an item of Chinese culture, but many have and people quite literally line up to have their picture taken in front of it.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><font size="4"><img src="/files/includes/images/lockers-cox_f-images-china2006-china20063.jpg" border="0" height="362" width="520" /></font></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><i>(photo of the Blue Iris Stone is from <a href="http://www.soil.ncsu.edu/lockers/Cox_F/China%20tour%202006.htm">this travelouge</a>) &nbsp;</i></p><p class="MsoNormal">I have to wonder though, am I being cynical and shallow or am I being realistic?<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;ve seen it happen before in tour groups &ndash; the guide makes a big hairy deal about something and the group eats it up and prepares the cameras without thought.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is where the tourist experience blends a little too closely with dollar signs.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tour groups need sights and the more the tourist is convinced that they are seeing something significant, the more likely they&rsquo;ll actually find some significance.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, from my perspective, a strong percentage of what a tourist sees is filler &ndash; something to make the tourist feel like they are having a great experience in between the things that are really impressive and important to them. <span>&nbsp;</span>I think this gets to the heart of why I loath tour groups &ndash; too much filler and not enough time to independently figure out what is significant to me. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The tour guide is very in tune with photo taking opportunities as well. He has surely observed the hoards take pictures of a sight and assumes that everyone should have one &ndash; including me. Sometimes I snap a quick picture just to make friends but at the same time I&rsquo;m thinking &ldquo;<i>If you really want to know what I want to take a picture of, it&rsquo;s the grotesque and barely alive condition of <b>your toenails</b>, Mr. Tour Guide.&rdquo;</i></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">It reminds me of <st1:city><st1:place>Las Vegas</st1:place></st1:city> and seeing people very excited to take a picture of a replica of Michael Angelo&rsquo;s masterpiece &ldquo;David&rdquo; at Caesar&rsquo;s Palace.<span>&nbsp; </span>I just want to say to them &ldquo;<i>That is not art you know, it is not historically significant, it is a piece of plaster put here for decoration alone</i>.&rdquo; But it doesn&rsquo;t matter, they think it&rsquo;s great and who am I to judge?</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">All this is leading to the realization that I don&rsquo;t like sightseeing.<span>&nbsp; </span>I yearn for reality or a historical and observable connection to the reality of a city or country. Modern history is endlessly fascinating.<span>&nbsp; </span>The spread of Communism in <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>, Mao Zedong, Pol Pol, Ho Chi Minh&hellip; I cannot learn enough about that part of history.<span>&nbsp; </span>Anything before about 1900 becomes somewhat opaque to me.<span>&nbsp; </span>I can&rsquo;t see as much reality in it or how it is affecting a country now.<span>&nbsp; </span>What really does it for me is learning the modern realities of a place &ndash; the politics, the social issues, the transportation system, food, what locals do, say and wear day-to-day.<span>&nbsp; </span>For me, this is endlessly real and represents something that I can grasp in my view of the world. Rocks and temples?<span>&nbsp; </span>Not so much.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I will gladly continue to see sights and learn about history, but I&rsquo;ll do it recognizing that there is a curiously real, entertaining and interesting aspect of tourism and tourists that can be quite rewarding to observe, even if the sights are not.</p>    <br class="clear" />

The tour operator likely gets a kick-back for every person who visits, so the traveler is a pawn in the competition for the tourist dollar. <span>&nbsp;</span>It&#39;s basically a stop at a gift shop with a bathroom that wastes time for the disinterested.<span>&nbsp; </span>Our group was clearly disinterested and the seeds of mutiny were sown.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">Prudence is a very nice and gentle tour guide and it was hard to conspire against her.<span>&nbsp; </span>We huddled together to plot our resistance - we would <b>not</b> be taking the tour and we would <b>demand</b> to get back on the bus and proceed to the Great Wall.<span>&nbsp; </span>Stephania was our leader and the negotiations began while each of us used the bathroom and returned to the sidewalk by the bus, sure not to be lured into the fold. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">Somewhere along the way, it was discovered that an espresso machine was present and the discussions were moved to ensure that Italians could get an espresso fix in the midst of the overthrow.<span>&nbsp; </span>A lesson in espresso-making ensued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black"><o:p></o:p></span><img src="/files/includes/images/80-237308971_61090d8435.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">Prudence put up a valiant fight for our time spent in the factory, insisting on 40 minutes, then 30, 20 and finally 10 before capitulating completely and allowing us to board the bus to the Wall.<span>&nbsp; </span>Stephania was our rock and the insurrection was complete before too much time was wasted...and there was much rejoicing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black">I encourage all travelers to call bullshit on the factory tour scheme when they travel - you will rarely find it on the itinerary before you buy the ticket, yet it will waste time that could be spent at the actual destination.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the group is small, ask about interest and organize your mutiny - remember that <b>you are paying</b> for the experience.<span>&nbsp; </span><b>Viva la R&eacute;sistance!</b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal">Oh, and we saw the Wall too...&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/79-237309925_53a7f62480.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/96-237309753_63e454d3b8.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />

    <p class="MsoNormal">I do love my wife &ndash; but she is such a huge nerd.<span>&nbsp; </span>Did you know she has a degree in microbiology? You&rsquo;d think with such knowledge, she would be more in tune with her own health.<span>&nbsp; </span>Before we left, Sachi saw an allergist and learned that she has allergies to trees and grasses &ndash; it affects her every year at home and her allergy medicine, which helps immensely, is in her backpack now.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometimes Sachi needs a reminder about this fact.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">For nearly the entire time that we&rsquo;ve been in <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> so far (3 weeks) Sachi has had cold-like symptoms.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, I have acquired a cold and gotten over it while her symptoms persist.<span>&nbsp; </span>Just today, I asked Sachi about the possibility of her symptoms being related to her allergies and a light bulb went on.<span>&nbsp; </span>After weeks of sneezing 50 times a day and wiping a chapped nose, the cure seemed so obvious &ndash; in fact it was not much further than the pack on her back. As of this afternoon, Sachi has fully recovered from the &ldquo;cold&rdquo;, thanks to Zyrtec. DUH.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I do not know why Sachi can&rsquo;t recognize her own allergies, but I am now on allergy alert on her behalf.<span>&nbsp; </span>Never again will I watch her suffer through weeks of a &ldquo;cold&rdquo; only to find that we&rsquo;ve been sharing the room with the cure the whole time.<span>&nbsp; </span>So much for microbiology.</p>  <br class="clear" />

    <div class="content">
    <p class="MsoNormal">There is a very particular and interesting type of Chinese gentleman that I&rsquo;ve been observing for a while now.<span>&nbsp; </span>He is perhaps the Chinese everyman, or the closest I can find to the type.<span>&nbsp; </span>He is an everyman in <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, but to me, the American visitor, he is quite foreign.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I do not wish to comment on his character or personality as I have not been able to communicate with him in any meaningful way.<span>&nbsp; </span>I can only comment on observing the multitudes of his kind from afar.<span>&nbsp; </span>For purposes of creating a meaningful persona, let&rsquo;s call him Chinese Bob.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/98-235735372_39501c55a3.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="393" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Chinese Bob is about 50 years old, about 5&rsquo;5&rdquo;, has a mildly receding hairline and a serious look on his roundish face, sometimes with a hint of consternation.<span>&nbsp; </span>His serious look is deceiving as he may break into boisterous laughter at any moment.<span>&nbsp; </span>His physique is rather stocky, with a plump midsection and a thick neck that extends from his ears. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I&rsquo;ve sat next to Chinese Bob in movie theaters, subways and park benches and can only describe the experience as a cavalcade of bodily noises.<span>&nbsp; </span>Bob has acute respiratory problems, causing him to groan out throat clearing half-coughs every few minutes and burp loudly without conscience.<span>&nbsp; </span>Chinese Bob can also been seen performing the very common snort-hock-spit routine on <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>&rsquo;s sidewalks, again, without conscience. <span>&nbsp;</span>This may be a symptom of his continuous smoking or general Chinese air quality.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">You might see Bob while leaving an elevator.<span>&nbsp; </span>He will be part of the group rushing into the elevator before you have time to get out. On the streets of <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, you might recognize Bob on a hot day by his exposed belly &ndash; he may be the one walking around with his shirt rolled up from the bottom or unbuttoned completely.<span>&nbsp; </span><br /><img src="/files/includes/images/62-223705747_41b584d6ff.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The one tried-and-true method of identifying Chinese Bob is by his footwear.<span>&nbsp; </span>Bob always wears the same shoes and socks.<span>&nbsp; </span>They are pointy-toed dress shoes with very thin, light-colored socks.<span>&nbsp; </span>You might even see Bob wear these shoes with athletic shorts as he ambles down the street with his posture laid back and his feet flopping forward.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/67-216459407_d09568a382.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">The other sure way to identify Chinese Bob is by watching him talk on a mobile phone.<span>&nbsp; </span>Actually, it&rsquo;s not something you observe so much as hear.<span>&nbsp; </span>Bob will seem to be yelling into his mobile phone without regard for his location. You can picture him saying &ldquo;<i>BIG BUSINESS HERE.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m talking BIG business everyone, BIG TIME.</i>&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>Bob is quite a big talker, I imagine.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I also imagine that Bob is a family man and a dedicated worker.<span>&nbsp; </span>Despite his foreignness and actions that sometimes seem repulsive to me, I know that Chinese Bob, if I could talk to him, would be a friendly and helpful person who might try to convince me to have a cigarette with him as he tells me about English football, Yao Ming and the upcoming Beijing Olympics.<span>&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately though, I don&rsquo;t speak Mandarin Chinese so I can only assume that, on observation alone, he finds me equally or more foreign and strange.</p>  <br class="clear" />
