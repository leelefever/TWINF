  <p>&nbsp;As I&rsquo;ve done a few times on our trip, I&rsquo;d like to get a little geeky and provide our experiences with mobile networks, Internet access and mobile blogging across regions of the world.<span>&nbsp; </span>We try to buy a local SIM card and experiment with the local networks via prepaid mobile phone plans, when reasonable. <span>&nbsp;</span>I cannot vouch for the completeness or accuracy of this information &ndash; it changes quickly and my perspective is one of a traveler.   </p><p class="MsoNormal"><i>See Also:</i><span>&nbsp; </span></p>    <ul><li><a href="/techreport-new-zealand">Tech Report New Zealand</a><span> &nbsp; <br /></span></li><li><span><a href="/dispatch/2006/04/02/tech-report-mobile-phone-networks-in-india-and-sri-lanka">Tech Report India and Sri Lanka</a>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></li><li><a href="/tech_report_thailand">Tech Report <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region></a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></li><li><a href="/tech_report_japan">Tech Report <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region></a></li></ul>          <p class="MsoNormal"><u><st1:country-region><st1:place><b>Russia</b></st1:place></st1:country-region></u><b><o:p></o:p></b></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><st1:city><st1:place><b>Mobile</b></st1:place></st1:city><b>:</b> The problem we experienced with the mobile networks in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> was that we could never find a pre-paid SIM card plan that would work across the whole country &ndash; they may exist, but we couldn&rsquo;t find one. <span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.telestial.com/view_product.php?PRODUCT_ID=LSIM-RU01">Megafon</a> may be a good bet. Also, see this <a href="http://www.cellular-news.com/coverage/russia.php">list of Russian providers</a>.<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">We moved quickly on the <a href="/tags/trans-siberian">Trans-Siberian Railway</a>, so it didn&rsquo;t make sense for us to get a SIM card that may only works for a few days. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><st1:country-region><st1:place>Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> cities generally have both GSM and CDMA.<span>&nbsp; </span>Our friends from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>UK</st1:place></st1:country-region> were able to use their phone from home to SMS family in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>UK</st1:place></st1:country-region> through many parts of the Trans-Siberian trip.<span>&nbsp; </span>GPRS is also available in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> depending on the service.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Internet:</b><span>&nbsp; </span>Wifi access is growing quickly in the major cities we visited, with access being very common <st1:city><st1:place>St.   Petersburg</st1:place></st1:city>, where our guesthouse (and many others) provided it for free. <span>&nbsp;</span>While our hotel in <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> didn&rsquo;t have wifi, there were many cafes and bars that had great free wifi access. Irkutsk and Yekaterinburg both had cafes that advertised free wifi access, but we rarely found anything that worked for us.<span>&nbsp; </span>Internet cafes were quite common and sporting strong connections.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, unlike <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>, I was not able to plug my own laptop into their network.<span>&nbsp; </span>This trend lasted through all of <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><u><st1:place><b>Scandinavia</b></st1:place><b> </b>(<st1:country-region><st1:place>Finland</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Sweden</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Norway</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Denmark</st1:place></st1:country-region>)</u></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Mobile:</b><span>&nbsp; </span>If there is anywhere a mobile device should work, it is <st1:place>Scandinavia</st1:place>, home of Nokia and some of the highest rates of mobile phone adoption in the world.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s true, it is easy to get a SIM card and the network is 3G, fast and consistent. However, the problem in traveling across <st1:place>Scandinavia</st1:place> is that the PrePaid plans do not work across countries without burning up minutes with expensive roaming.<span>&nbsp; </span>Plus, if you get a plan in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Finland</st1:place></st1:country-region> and run out of minutes in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Norway</st1:place></st1:country-region>, it is impossible to top-up your plan.<span>&nbsp; </span>The pre-paid plans don&rsquo;t travel well.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was hoping to find an all-Scandinavia plan but came up empty.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Internet Access:</b><span>&nbsp; </span>We found free wi-fi to be quite easy to find in cities like <st1:city><st1:place>Helsinki</st1:place></st1:city>, <st1:city><st1:place>Oslo</st1:place></st1:city> and Copenhangen.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many hotels offer wifi as an included part of the room &ndash; though you may have to ask for the password.<span>&nbsp; </span>While wifi is easy, Internet cafes are not as easy.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;ve found that, in general, Internet cafes are easiest to find in a) places where people cannot afford personal computers, like in <st1:place>SE Asia</st1:place> b) places on the backpacker trail, like <st1:place><st1:city>Florence</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Italy</st1:country-region></st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span>With <st1:place>Scandinavia</st1:place> being neither, internet cafes are harder to find &ndash; but still available.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><u><st1:place><b>Europe</b></st1:place></u><b><u>:</u><o:p></o:p></b></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Mobile:</b> We entered <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> from <st1:city><st1:place>Amsterdam</st1:place></st1:city>, <st1:city><st1:place>Holland</st1:place></st1:city> and it was from here that we started our Vodafone adventure.<span>&nbsp; </span>Vodafone is one of the major European providers that is close to providing near-seamless access across the continent.<span>&nbsp; </span>The key point with a service like Vodafone is that you can travel across countries and still be able to top-up your prepaid account.<span>&nbsp; </span>Vodafone stores are everywhere.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, if you have a Vodafone card from one country and travel to another *be sure* to explain to the Vodafone rep that you need a refill voucher card for foreign cards &ndash; they are different from domestic cards.<span>&nbsp; </span>Also, when topping-up your account from abroad, note that you must use a different menu item on the voice menu &ndash; wait for the menu to ask about a *foreign* voucher number. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">We bought a Vodafone prepaid SIM card in <st1:city><st1:place>Amsterdam</st1:place></st1:city> and immediately connected to the voice network.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, the phone (Palm Treo 650) would not connect to GPRS with the built-in settings.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I would try to edit the GPRS Network settings provided by Vodafone, the phone would tell me they are locked.<span>&nbsp; </span>After talking to the Vodafone helpline a couple of times, I learned that I had to add a new network connection with a different APN.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m sorry that I don&rsquo;t have the info on the APN right now, but the Vodafone help line can help.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Within a couple of days, we had both GSM and GPRS working on the phone.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, we left <st1:city><st1:place>Holland</st1:place></st1:city> and quickly discovered that the coverage may be near-ubiquitous, but there are penalties for roaming.<span>&nbsp; </span>After leaving <st1:city><st1:place>Holland</st1:place></st1:city>, we burned through prepaid minutes like wildfire.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was amazed at how quickly GPRS access would burn up minutes. <span>&nbsp;</span>Usually, international voice costs about 1 Euro for the connection and then something like .75 Euros per minute after than. <span>&nbsp;</span>The EU is about to regulate the industry in <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> by forcing them to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000085&amp;sid=aV4Kesd8jQ6I&amp;refer=europe">cut roaming charges by 40-60%</a>.&nbsp;<span></span>I am a fan &ndash; the charges are ridiculous.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Then lesson here is to watch out for roaming charges within <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> on Vodafone.<span>&nbsp; </span>You cannot travel across countries without roaming charges.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Internet:</b> In most of <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> there is no shortage of Internet cafes, particularly if backpackers are frequent.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most cafes charge 3-5 Euros per hour of access.<span>&nbsp; </span>No Internet cafes would allow me to plug my laptop into their network.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, many Internet cafes have wifi that you can use for the same rate as a terminal.<span>&nbsp; </span>We found that outside the major cities in southern <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>, wifi is less available.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">A final note:<span>&nbsp; </span>A gadget that would be amazing to have while traveling is a <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/accessories/6f76/">wifi detector</a> so that you could be walking through a <st1:city><st1:place>new city</st1:place></st1:city> and find a wifi signal with ease.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp; </span>People sniffed out a wifi signal on a random section of street in <st1:city><st1:place>Siena</st1:place></st1:city> <st1:country-region><st1:place>Italy</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<img src="/files/includes/images/101-287575380_e2f631cd38_m.jpg" /></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><o:p>&nbsp;Conclusion</o:p></b></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">In general, across all 29 countries we visited (except <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>), an unlocked GSM phone will work for voice calling.<span>&nbsp; </span>What is much harder, but still possible nearly everywhere is connecting to GPRS (Internet, email, data).<span>&nbsp; </span>If you absolutely need to connect to GPRS, take a very mainstream and popular phone, such as a Nokia, because the phone store people will have instructions for the connection.<span>&nbsp; </span>I had problems using a Palm Treo 650 because many foreign data plans did not support it for GPRS. </p>  <br class="clear" />

      <h2><a href="/communism" title="On Communism">On Communism</a></h2>

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on December 28, 2006 - 10:31am</div>

    <div class="content">

  <p><i>I wrote this entry in September of 2006 from Helsinki, Finland just after arriving there from the Trans-Siberian Railway and a month in China.&nbsp; For a while I was consumed by learning about Communism and needed to get it on paper, so to speak.</i></p><hr size="2" width="100%" /><p class="MsoNormal">This post is a bit of a departure from the usual travel topics and I hope you&rsquo;ll pardon its serious and dark nature. Having been to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Czech Republic</st1:place></st1:country-region>, Communism seems to be a recurring theme and something to which I&rsquo;ve devoted a lot of time reading and learning. I&rsquo;ve developed a fascination for the subject, likely more than any other subject on the trip. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I figure that the root of my fascination is related to the fact that so many smart people believed in it so fervently and killed so many in an attempt to make it work &ndash; and the work continues to this day.<span>&nbsp; </span>To me as an American entrepreneur, Communism is endlessly fascinating because it diverges so greatly from my world view.<span>&nbsp; </span>The more I learn about it, the more baffled I become that so many could believe that it is a perfectly reasonable way to run a country.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I started the trip knowing very little about the Communist ideology, Marxism, Leninism or the history of the peoples&rsquo; revolution.<span>&nbsp; </span>After reading a number of books, visiting museums, etc., I think I have a handle on some of the basics.<span>&nbsp; </span>To test myself, I&rsquo;d like to try to describe my layman&#39;s version for you as briefly and simply as possible.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Karl Marx was known as the father of Communism and the author of the Communist Manifesto &ndash; the first declaration of his theory in late 19<sup>th</sup> century. To Marx, capitalism (free markets, supply and demand, etc.) was evil and would eventually cause great misery to the people of the world. His goal was to stop it.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">To understand why he thought this, we must consider the lives of workers in the Industrial Revolution of the 1800s.<span>&nbsp; </span>At the time he saw a world where people were either rich owners or exploited and unhappy workers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Marx saw this as a great injustice that was getting worse through the growth of Capitalism.<span>&nbsp; </span>He foresaw a future where Capitalism would create a small handful of rich people and a world of miserable people that would get more miserable over time. This would even be extended to a worldwide scale with the world eventually being run by a few rich industrialists. This was what some called Imperialism and it was the end game of Capitalism.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Marx was successful in convincing a lot of very smart and powerful people that his was the true vision of the world and his Communist ideology its savior.<span>&nbsp; </span>He promoted the idea that the true power of a civilization lies within the working class and if properly motivated, the working class can rise up in revolution against the rich land owners. This was revolution and it was the first stage of building a Communist system which would be fair to everyone &ndash; a single class society that worked to provide what it needed for the whole society. The government owned everything and everyone worked toward a common goal of self-sufficiency.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, according to the theory, there would be no need for government in the future &ndash; it would &ldquo;whither away&rdquo; as the Communist utopia was achieved. Everyone would be well fed, protected and happy as they worked together as one.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Of course, history shows that this is not the case.<span>&nbsp; </span>Two contributing factors:</p>    <ul style="margin-top: 0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal">Marx      got it wrong.<span>&nbsp; </span>He did not predict      the rapid rise of the middle class.<span>&nbsp;      </span>Before he died, he saw Capitalism creating opportunities for a new class      that were neither the rich owner nor the exploited worker.</li></ul>    <ul style="margin-top: 0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal">Marxism      was just a theory:<span>&nbsp; </span>It described how      things should work and what should happen, but it never described *how*      Communism or revolution should actually be managed.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was a theory with no doctrine. </li></ul>    <p class="MsoNormal">Of course in the 20<sup>th</sup> century there would be no shortage of world leaders to test the Marxist theory in the form of prompting a revolution and establishing a Communist government &ndash; supposedly freeing the working classes from Capitalist oppression.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The first serious revolutionary was Lenin in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>. He put Marxist theory into practice and established the first Communist government in 1917 and in doing so created Leninism &ndash; the way a person goes about revolution and enacting Marxist principles.<span>&nbsp; </span>This created what is known as Marxism/Leninism and became a complete package for people like Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh and Pol Pot in <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span>They now had the idea (Marxism) and the practice (Leninism) for Communist Revolution.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">What has happened since then is the subject of great debate. Most would agree that if there is a winner in the Cold War, it is Capitalism. Many questions remain about what went wrong with Communism.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ll let you research the myriad perspectives on what happened and leave you with my own admittedly half-baked answer.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">I think there are two main reasons Communism failed.<span>&nbsp; </span>The first is human nature.<span>&nbsp; </span>Communism underestimated the human need for achievement, competition and recognition.<span>&nbsp; </span>Making everyone the same reduced everyone to the lowest common denominator and bred more misery and frustration than it prevented.<span>&nbsp; </span>The second reason is leadership.<span>&nbsp; </span>Have you ever heard of the founder of a company having to hire a CEO?<span>&nbsp; </span>It happens often because the people that start things are not often the best people to manage them.<span>&nbsp; </span>Revolutionaries are great at revolution, but can be poor at administration and management.<span>&nbsp; </span>The history of Communism is rife with stories of Mao, Stalin and Pol Pot making ludicrous decisions that caused the deaths of millions of their people.<span>&nbsp; </span>They grew omnipotent through revolution but lacked the skills to use that power in any responsible manner. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">My guess is that human history will show Communism as a destructive and deadly force in the world, not because of the idea or theory, but its implementation.<span>&nbsp; </span>It enabled the centralization of absolute power that bred mass corruption and quickly became unmanageable.<span>&nbsp; </span>To give you an idea of the level of destruction, consider the number of deaths in these countries in the Communist era:</p>    <ul style="margin-top: 0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal"><st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>      and Mao&rsquo;s Great Leap Forward (1950&rsquo;s)<span>&nbsp;      </span>- 30 million dead from starvation</li><li class="MsoNormal"><st1:country-region><st1:place>Cambodia</st1:place></st1:country-region>      and Pol Pot&rsquo;s Communist Revolution (1970&rsquo;s) 7 million dead from starvation      and executions (1 in 7 Cambodians)</li><li class="MsoNormal"><st1:country-region><st1:place>Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>      and Stalin&rsquo;s Iron Rule (1920-50s) &ndash; 40 million dead from starvation and      executions</li></ul>    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in">&hellip; and this is not counting the unquantifiable misery wrought on families and individuals in these countries as secret police, hidden agendas and propaganda were a fact of life.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">Could a system of government that produced numbers like this be considered a positive force in the world?<span>&nbsp; </span>I think not. Yet, the Communist Party is still a major player in world politics.<span>&nbsp; </span>In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> it has considerable power and of course in <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>North   Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region> it is the dominant force. How could this be? How could there still be demand for such a system?<span>&nbsp; </span>The answer lies somewhere in the real world security and equality that Communism provides the working class.<span>&nbsp; </span>Despite the horrific past, some people still yearn for a system where they can depend on the government for everything &ndash; they are ready to trade freedom for security.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Maybe the real root of my fascination with Communism is related to how it helps me to understand all the things I take for granted.<span>&nbsp; </span>The more I learn, the more I wonder what my life would be like if I was a child of Communism.<span>&nbsp; </span>With an entrepreneurial American worldview, I find it nearly unfathomable.</p><p class="MsoNormal">For more reading, check out the Wikipedia entries on:&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism">Communism</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong">Mao Zedong</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_pot">Pol Pot</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx">Karl Marx</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx">Marxism</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism">Capitalism</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism">Dictatorship of the Proleteriat</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism">Imperialism</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><br class="clear" />

    <p class="MsoNormal">It&rsquo;s quite apparent that the Russians have mixed feelings about <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> (depending on where you ask) and after a few days there I think we feel the same. It was at once harsh and smooth, rude and friendly, ugly and beautiful.<span>&nbsp; </span>Overall though, I&rsquo;d say it was better than I expected.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/105-252293946_b2e37f4a21.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Of course we had friends in the city that showed us around their neighborhoods and homes, which was a perfect introduction to the city. The warmth of the personal connection with people in <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> made us feel at home.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, once we ventured out on our own, other sides of the city appeared</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/95-252293749_5a1db75ef7.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Suddenly I found myself in center of the former Communist stronghold, surrounded by reminders of the Bolshevik Revolution, the <st1:country-region><st1:place>USSR</st1:place></st1:country-region> and Communism.<span>&nbsp; </span>I saw the Kremlin-adjacent apartments where Stalin&rsquo;s cronies were arrested and shot.<span>&nbsp; </span>I ate at places where people once stood in line for bread.<span>&nbsp; </span>All the things I learned about the Russians and Communism were right there before me and I could feel the power.<span>&nbsp; </span>In <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> the grandeur of the buildings are awe-inspiring &ndash; monuments to a government that controlled 1/6<sup>th</sup> of the earth&rsquo;s surface and had plans for world domination.<span>&nbsp; </span>This was the place, right under my feet.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/95-252294291_a25f28aa21.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">And it is beautiful.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tiananmen has nothing on <st1:place>Red Square</st1:place>. The parks, rivers and thoroughfares are quite delightful, especially on a nice day. <span>&nbsp;</span>I had no idea that <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> was covered in parks. The legendary Metro subway system is showing its age, but still maintains a world class level of elegance and efficiency.<span>&nbsp; </span>The street food is always-on and yummy. The drab and cold <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> I expected was a distant vision, but some of what I had heard was confirmed.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">It is said that <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> is the &ldquo;dictator&rdquo; and <st1:city><st1:place>St. Petersburg</st1:place></st1:city> is the &ldquo;artist&rdquo; and having visited both, it is obvious why.<span>&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> is not a warm and fuzzy sort of place for the visitor.<span>&nbsp; </span>Customer service is very short and cold, there is no English anywhere and downtown sometimes seems covered in police. The people you encounter appear quite gloomy with very few smiles. Also, there is no affordable lodging in the center of town, forcing travelers 20 minutes outside the city.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/100-252293791_9f5acf5def.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">One of the important things that travelers must remember in <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> is to carry copies of their visa and passport with them at all times.<span>&nbsp; </span>Often police/military will stop foreigners and ask for passports to extort large sums of money.<span>&nbsp; </span>If an actual passport is handed over, it may cost to get it back.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of our friends was caught urinating outdoors by a young military officer in an oversized uniform and threatened with the &ldquo;Gulag&rdquo; if he didn&rsquo;t hand over his actual passport instead of copies. Our friend pretended to call his embassy which caused the officer to reduced the penalty to 500 Rubles (USD$20).<span>&nbsp; </span>They ended up settling at 200 Rubles. To be fair to both sides &ndash; public restrooms are impossible to find in <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city>, and the military boys do not get paid one ruble for their two years of mandated service.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><img src="/files/includes/images/108-252294153_375d086a33.jpg-v-0.jpg" onload="show_notes_initially();" class="reflect" height="375" width="500" /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">On the other side of the coin, the personal experiences we had with random Muscovites were more positive.<span>&nbsp; </span>While looking at a map on a street corner one night (the &ldquo;tourist distress call&rdquo;) a friendly young woman pointed us in the right direction.<span>&nbsp; </span>It seems that in general, the young people represent a new generation of Muscovites who are more likely to smile, provide great service and welcome foreigners.<span>&nbsp; </span>I would love to come back to <st1:city><st1:place>Moscow</st1:place></st1:city> in 15 years to see how it has changed.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m quite sure that it will be less of a dictator.</p>  <br class="clear" />

    <div class="content">

  <p>From the moment we arrived in Yekaterinburg, Russia, I had the song &quot;<a href="http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Modest-Mouse/The-Cold-Part.html">The Cold Part</a>&quot; by Modest Mouse playing in my head, which is  a dark and desolate song that sings &quot;so long to this cold, cold part of the world&quot;.  I don&#39;t think the city is as cold and dark as I chose to display in the video, but I do think the video fits with the soundtrack that was playing in my head at the time.</p>    <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9F8FtXTJTe8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"></embed>  <p>The scenes at the end are from our homestay in Yaketerinburg.  We stayed with a local named Eleana for two nights in former Communist housing blocks.

    <div class="info">By: leelefever on September 25, 2006 - 6:04am</div>

    <div class="content">

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Given the opportunity, we will choose to hang out with the locals and in nearly every instance.<span>&nbsp; </span>The vast majority of the time, it has been a rewarding and interesting experience.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, on the Trans-Siberian Railway we&rsquo;ve learned that there are Russian locals that you don&rsquo;t necessarily want to &ldquo;experience&rdquo; for 2 days on a train.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Peer pressure is an issue on the Trans-Siberian train with consistent reminders from other travelers that this is the &ldquo;vodka train&rdquo; and you must drink Russian vodka.<span>&nbsp; </span>This pressure is lost on the Russian locals though as they need no pressure whatsoever to drink on a train.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is a requirement for them and when mixing with foreign travelers the requirement is shared by all.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">So we found ourselves in the dining car on the second night of a 48 hour journey from Irkustk to Ekaterineburg.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Between Slava, the gigantic ex-Russian Army captain with bullet wounds and Victor, the pudgy Belushi-esque ex-Mafia family man, we had our hands full.<span>&nbsp; </span>While our English friend Paul was busy being pressured by Slava into drinking more vodka than he wanted, I got a dose of vodka with Victor and his fellow Russian friends, who seemed to be complete blockheads.<span>&nbsp; </span>We drank more, became friends, toasted to health, arm wrestled and looking back I can say that I have never witnessed so many scars on so many people.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think these guys have had a hard life.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">For some reason I accepted Victor&rsquo;s invitation for me and Sachi to come to his room and drink more vodka. Not only did this end up with me losing a few hours of memory, but it caused Sachi to end up babysitting Victor&rsquo;s Coke-spewing 4 year old child &ldquo;Sergei&rdquo; for over an hour.<span>&nbsp; </span>She was not happy and I had no idea why.<span>&nbsp; </span>What I did remember was Victor telling me at some point in the night that the wolf tattoo on his arm was from his 3 year prison term.<span>&nbsp; </span>Apparently had &ldquo;only killed one person&rdquo; while in the Russian mafia.<span>&nbsp; </span>Had I had my wits about me, I may have escaped at that point, but I didn&rsquo;t.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The next day I awoke to a hangover, an upset wife and a half-drunk Russian ex-con banging on the door at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9AM</st1:time> with a 2 liter beer in his hand.<span>&nbsp; </span>We were still friends and he was clearly doing me a favor by bring over the beer. <span>&nbsp;</span>He started with the old Russian saying &ldquo;A good friend drinks vodka with you yesterday, a great friend drinks vodka with you today!&rdquo; as if I might appreciate the classical nature of the moment.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>I would have none of it, despite him barging in, pouring a glass, spilling it on the floor and insisting I drink no less than 15 times. Of course Sachi was now noticing that she would now clean up after both father and son in our compartment. I was at a loss for more ways to say &ldquo;nyet&rdquo; &ndash; nothing seemed to work. Sachi would later say that when he came in she wanted to kick him in the face.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course, I was implicit in this frustration. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Later Victor hooked back up with the Blockheads and they formed a roaming band of drunk-in-the-morning Russian annoyances.<span>&nbsp; </span>They went from one end of the train to the other, peer-pressuring everyone from the night before to drink with them.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of them even forced his way into the compartment of understandably shaken American and Canadian girls.<span>&nbsp; </span>He would later be quite accurately called a stalker.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">This band of drunks eventually caused the revelers from the night before to close their doors and hide out for the majority of the morning.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many, including Sachi and I ignored knocks at our doors.<span>&nbsp; </span>The foreigners on the train tried to memorize compartment numbers so we could visit one another without keeping a door open.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was talk of passwords being used.<span>&nbsp; </span>We were held hostage by the locals.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">By about <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1pm</st1:time> the drunk Russians had passed out &ndash; we could hear Victor snoring through the compartment walls and from that point the foreigners on the train began to appear like refugees after a bombing campaign.<span>&nbsp; </span>Shaken, annoyed and hungover, we stuck together and decided that drinking with the locals is fun, but sharing 2 days on a train with the same people is another story all together.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Watch the <a href="/47/vodka_train">Video Here</a>. <br /></p>  <br class="clear" />
